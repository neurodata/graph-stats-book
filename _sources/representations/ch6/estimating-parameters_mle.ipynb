    "When we learned about random networks which can be described using single network models, one of the key things we covered were the *parameters* that define the underlying random networks. If we see a network which is a realization of a random network, we do *not*, in practice, know what those parameters that describe the random network are. However, we have a slight problem, because learning about the underlying random network *requires* us to have some understanding of the parameters that define it. What are we to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome this hurdle, we must *estimate* the parameters of the underlying random network. At a very high level, **estimation** is a procedure to calculate properties about a random variable (or a set of random variables) using only the data we are given: finitely many (in network statistics, often just one) samples which we assume are realizations of the random variable we want to learn about. Here, what we want to obtain are ways in which we can *estimate* the parameters of the underlying random network, when we have a realization of a random network.\n",

    "Recall that the Erdös-Rényi (ER) network has a single parameter: the probability of each edge existing, which we termed $p$. Due to the simplicity of a random network which is ER, we can resort to the Maximum Likelihood technique we described above, and it turns out we obtain virtually the same result. We find that the best estimate of the probability of an edge existing in an ER random network is just the ratio of the total number of edges in the network, $m$, divided by the total number of edges possible in the network, which is $\\binom n 2$! Our result is:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\hat p &= \\frac{m}{\\binom n 2}.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, the estimate of the probability $p$ is the ratio of how many edges we see in the network, $m$, and how many edges we could have seen $\\binom n 2$! To bring this back to our coin flip example, this is like we are saying that there is a single coin. We flip the coin once for every possible edge between those pairs of communities, $\\binom n 2$. When that coin lands on heads, that particular edge is determined to exist, and when it lands on tails, that edge does not exist. Our best guess, then, is just to count the number of heads we obtained, $m$, and divide by the number of coin flips we made, $\\binom n 2$. \n",
