    "In many problems, your network might be more than just the information contained in its adjacency matrix (called its **network topology**, or its collection of nodes and edges). If you were investigating a social network, you might have access to extra information about each person -- their gender, for instance, or their age. If you were investigating a brain network, you might have information about the physical location of neurons, or some notion of how big a brain region is. When you embed a network, it seems like you should be able to use these extra bits of information - called the \"features\" or \"covariates\" of a network - to somehow improve your analysis. The techniques and tools that you'll explore in this section use both the covariates and the topology of a network to create and learn from new representations of the network. Because they jointly use both the topology of the network and its extra covariate information, these techniques and tools are called joint representation learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary reasons that you might want to explore using node covariates in addition to topological structure. First, they might improve your standard embedding algorithms, like Laplacian and Adjacency Spectral Embedding. For example, if the latent structure of the covariates of a network lines up with the latent structure of its topology, then you might be able to reduce noise when you embed, even if the communities in your network don't overlap perfectly with the communities in your covariates. Second, figuring out what the clusters of an embedding actually mean can sometimes be difficult and covariates create a natural structure in your network that you can explore. Covariate information in brain networks telling you where in the brain each node is, for instance, might let us better understand the types of characteristics that distinguish between different brain regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you'll explore different ways to learn from your data when you have access to the covariates of a network in addition to its topological structure. You'll explore *Covariate-Assisted Spectral Embedding* (CASE), a variation on Spectral Embedding developed by {cite:p}`Binkiewicz2017Jun`. In CASE, instead of embedding just the adjacency matrix or its Laplacian, you'll combine the Laplacian and your covariates into a new matrix and embed that."

    "A good way to illustrate how using covariates might help us is to use a model in which some of your community information is in the covariates and some is in your topology. Using the Stochastic Block Model from {numref}`ch5:sbm`, weâ€™ll create a simulation using three communities: the first and second community will be indistinguishable in the topological structure of a network, and the second and third community will be indistinguishable in the covariates. By combining the topology and the covariates, you'll get a nice embedding that lets you find three distinct community clusters."

The first $50$ students attend school $1$, the second $50$ students attend school $2$, and the third $50$ students attend school $3$. Edges of your adjacency matrix represent whether a pair of individuals are friends or not. You want to be able to identify which school each individual is from, but you have a problem that differentiates this situation from the traditional stochastic block model setting.\n",

In this sense, the probability that two students are friends if they are both from the same school will be relatively high, but the probability that two students are friends if they are from different schools is low. On the other hand, the second and third schools are not co-ed: they are religious schools which provide education for students who identify as male or female separately. These students have a \"brother/sister\" relationship: all of their social events and school functions are performed jointly. Pairs of students who attend these two schools, it turns out, have a relatively similar chance of being friends regardless of which school they attend."

If your network is *non-assortative* - meaning, the between-block probabilities are greater than the within-block probabilities - it's better to square your Laplacian. This is because the adjacency matrices of non-assortative networks have a lot of negative eigenvalues; squaring the Laplacian gets rid of a lot of annoying negative eigenvalues, and you end up with a better embedding. In the non-assortative case, you end up embedding $LL + aYY^\\top$.
