    "In many network problems, our network might be more than just its topology (its collection of nodes and edges). If we were investigating a social network, we might have access to extra information about each person -- their gender, for instance, or their age. If we were investigating a brain network, we might have information about the physical location of neurons, or the volume of a brain region. When we we embed a network, it seems like we should be able to use these extra bits of information - called the \"features\" or \"covariates\" of a network - to somehow improve our analysis. The techniques and tools that we'll explore in this section use both the covariates and the topology of a network to create and learn from new representations of our network. Because these new representations jointly use both the topology of our network and its extra covariate information, these techniques and tools are called joint representation learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary reasons that we might want to explore using node covariates in addition to topological structure. First, they might improve our standard embedding algorithms, like Laplacian and Adjacency Spectral Embedding. For example, if the latent structure of the covariates of a network lines up with the latent structure of its topology, then we might be able to reduce noise when we embed, even if the communities in our network don't overlap perfectly with the communities in our covariates. Second, figuring out what the clusters of an embedding actually mean can sometimes be difficult and covariates create a natural structure in our network that we can explore. Covariate information in brain networks telling us where in the brain each node is, for instance, might let us better understand the types of characteristics that distinguish between different brain regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll explore different ways to learn from our data when we have access to these covariates of a network in addition to its topological structure. We'll explore *Covariate-Assisted Spectral Embedding* (CASE), a variation on Spectral Embedding. In CASE, instead of embedding just the adjacency matrix or one of the many versions of its Laplacian, we'll combine the Laplacian and our covariates into a new matrix and embed that."

Using the Stochastic Block Model, we’ll create a simulation using three communities: the first and second community will be indistinguishable in the topological structure of a network, and the second and third community will be indistinguishable in its covariates. By combining the topology and the covariates, we'll get a nice embedding that lets us find three distinct community clusters."

    "We have a range of possible weights to search through, but we don't have the best one. To find it, we'll embed with Covariate-Assisted Clustering, using all the tricks described previously, for as many alpha-values in our range as we're willing to test. Then, we'll simply pick the value which best lets us distinguish between the different communities in our network. \n",
    "\n",
    "To figure out which $\\alpha$ is best, we need to cluster our data using a machine learning algorithm. The algorithm of choice will be scikit-learn's faster implementation of k-means. K-means is a simple algorithm capable of clustering most datasets very quickly and efficiently, often in only a few iterations. It works by initially sticking some number of predetermined cluster centers in essentially random places in our data, and then iterating through a searching procedure until all the cluster centers are in nice places. If you want more information, you can check out the original paper by Stuart Lloyd<sup>2</sup>, or scikit-learn's tutorial describing K-means<sup>3</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to define exactly what it means to check which tuning values produce the best clustering. We want a metric that emphasizes clusters that are small and far apart; that way, our clusters will be distinct and we'll be able to see our community structure better. Scikit-learn has exactly the metric we need: the *silhouette score*. This metric outputs a large number if our clusters are far apart, and a small number if our clusters are close together. For more details, see the scikit-learn documentation<sup>4</sup>.\n",
