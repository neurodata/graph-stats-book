    "Let's imagine that you have a company with $45$ total employees. $10$ of these employees are company administrative executives, $25$ of these employees are network machine learning experts, and $10$ of these employees are marketing experts. You study the social media habits of your employees on Facebook, Twitter, and Linkedin. For a given social networking site, an edge is said to exist between a pair of employees if they are connected on the social media site (by being friends, following one another, or being connected, respectively). As it turns out, individuals tend to most closely associate with the colleagues whom they work most closely: you might expect some sort of community structure to your network, wherein network machine learning experts are more connected with network machine learning experts, marketing experts are more connected with marketing experts, so on and so forth. What you will see below is that all of the networks appear to have the same community organization, though on Linkedin, you see that the administrative executives tend to be a little more connected. This is reflected in the fact that there are more connections between Adm. members on Linkedin:"

    "Remember that a random network has an adjacency matrix denoted by a boldfaced uppercase $\\mathbf A$, and has network samples $A$ (which you just call \"networks\"). When you have multiple networks, you will need to be able to index them individually. For this reason, in this section, you will use the convention that a random network's adjacency matrix is denoted by a boldfaced uppercase $\\mathbf A^{(m)}$, where $m$ tells you which network in your collection you are talking about. The capital letter $M$ defines the *total* number of random networks in your collection. In your social network example, since you have connection networks for $3$ sites, $N$ is $3$. When you use the letter $m$ itself, you will typically be referring to an arbitrary random network among the collection of random networks, where $m$ is between $1$ and $N$. When you have $M$ total networks, you will write down the entire **collection of random networks** using the notation $\\left\\{\\mathbf A^{(1)}, ..., \\mathbf A^{(M)}\\right\\}$. With what you already know, for a random network $\\mathbf A^{(m)}$, you would be able to use a single nework model to describe $\\mathbf A^{(m)}$. This means, for instance, if you thought that each social network could be represented by a different RDPG, that you would have a *different* latent position matrix $X^{(m)}$ to define each of the $30$ networks. In symbols, you would write that each $\\mathbf A^{(m)}$ is an RDPG random nework with latent position matrix $X^{(m)}$. What is the problem with this description?\n",
    "\n",
    "What this description lacks is that the three networks share a *lot* of common information. You might expect that, on some level, the latent position matrices should also show some sort of common structure. However, since you used a *unique* latent position matrix $X^{(m)}$ for each random network $\\mathbf A^{(m)}$, you have inherently stated that you think that the networks have completely distinct latent position matrices. If you were to perform a task downstream, such as whether you could identify which employees are in which community, you would have to analyze each latent position matrix individually, and you would not be able to learn a latent position matrix with shared structure across the three networks. Before you jump into multiple network models, let's provide some context as to how you will build these up.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the below descriptions, you will tend to build off the Random Dot Product Graph (RDPG), and closely related variations of it. Why? Well, as it turns out, the RDPG is extremely flexible, in that you can represent both ER and SBMs as RDPGs, too. You'll remember from {ref}`ch5:unify_sn` that the ER network was a special case of the SBM and SBMs were special cases of RDPG networks, so the RDPG can describe any network which is an RDPG, an SBM, or an ER random network. This means that building off the RDPG gives you multiple random network models that will be inherently flexible. Further, as you will see in the later section on {ref}`ch6`, the RDPG is extremely well-suited for the situation in which you want to analyze SBMs, but do not know which communities the nodes are in ahead of time. This situation is extremely common across numerous disciplines of network machine learning, such as social networking, neuroscience, and many other fields.\n",

    "So, how can you model your collection of random networks with shared structure?\n",

    "In our example on social networks, notice that the Facebook and Twitter connections do not look *too* qualitatively different. It looks like they have relatively similar connectivity patterns between the different employee working groups, and you might even think that the underlying random network that governs these two social networks are *identical*. In statisical science, when we have a collection of $M$ random networks that have the same underlying random process, we describe this with the term **homogeneity**. Let's put what this means into context using your coin flip example. If a pair of coins are *homogeneous*, this means that the probability that they land on heads is identical. Likewise, this intuition extends directly to random networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **homogeneous** collection of independent-edge random networks $\\left\\{\\mathbf A^{(1)}, ..., \\mathbf A^{(M)}\\right\\}$ is one in which *all* of the $M$ random networks have the *same probability matrix*, and consequently have the same distribution (statistically, the term is *identically distributed*). Remember that the probability matrix $P^{(m)}$ is the matrix whose entries $p^{(m)}_{ij}$ indicate the probability that an edge exists between nodes $i$ and $j$. This is because the probability matrix is the fundamental unit which can be used to describe independent-edge random networks, as we learned in {ref}`ch5:ier`. On the other hand, a **heterogeneous** collection of random networks is a collection of networks $\\left\\{\\mathbf A^{(1)}, ..., \\mathbf A^{(M)}\\right\\}$ is one in which the probability matrices are *not* the same for all of the $M$ networks, and hence, they are *not* identically distributed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The probability matrices $P^{(1)}$ and $P^{(2)}$ for the random networks $\\mathbf A^{(1)}$ and $\\mathbf A^{(2)}$ for Facebook and Twitter from the example we introduced above are shown in the following figure. You can also show the difference between the two probability matrices, to make really clear that they are the same:"

    "Even though $P^{(1)}$ and $P^{(3)}$ are not *identical*, you can see they still share *some* structure: the employee teams are the same between the two social networks, and much of the probability matrix is unchanged. For this reason, it will be useful for you to have a network model which allows you to convey *some* shared structure, but still lets you convey aspects of the different networks which are *unique*. Ultimately, our goal with network modelling is to make sense of the networks we observe downstream, which is difficult to do when there are too many things you need to estimate or think about simultaneously. This *shared structure* will allow you to *borrow strength* when you estimate, which will allow you to feasibly estimate all of the ingredients you will need to describe COSIE networks. The COSIE model will accomplish this using a *shared latent position matrix* to describe the *similarities*, and unique *score matrices* to describe the *differences*, for each of the random networks. Let's learn about what these are.\n",

    "The *shared latent position matrix* for the COSIE model is quite similar to the latent position matrix for an RDPG. Like the latent position matrix, the shared latent position matrix $V$ is a matrix with $n$ rows (one for each node) and $d$ columns. The $d$ columns behave very similarly to the $d$ columns for the latent position matrix of an RDPG, and $d$ is referred to as the *latent dimensionality* of the COSIE random networks. Like before, each row of the shared latent position matrix $\\vec v_i$ will denote the shared latent position vector for node $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also add an additional restriction to $V$: it will be a matrix with orthonormal columns. What this means is that for each column of $V$, the dot product of the column with itself is $1$, and the dot product of the column with any other column is $0$. This has the implication that $V^\\top V = I$, the identity matrix. All this has the effect of doing is it gives you a sense of uniform scale for all of the columns (scale $1$) of the latent position matrix. This has the effect of allowing the other component, the *score matrix*, to be interpretable, which you will learn more about in the next subsection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The shared latent position matrix conveys the *common structure* between the COSIE random networks, and will be a parameter for each of the neworks. Remember that with the $JRDPG_n(X)$ model, you were able to express the homogeneity of the social networks on Facebook and Twitter, but you could not capture the heterogeneity of the social nework on Linkedin. However, you want the shared latent position matrix $V$ to convey the commonality among the three social networks; that is, that the employees are always working on the same employee teams.

    "Finally, let's relate all of this back to the COSIE model. The way you can think about the COSIE model is that for each random network that you have, the probability matrix $P^{((m)}$ depends on the shared latent position matrix $V$ and the score matrix $R^{(m)}$. The probability matrix $P^{(m)}$ for the $m^{th}$ random network is defined so that $P^{(m)} = VR^{(m)}V^\\top$. This means that each entry $p_{ij}^{(m)} = \\vec v_i^\\top R^{(m)} \\vec v_j$. We say that a collection of random networks $\\left\\{\\mathbf A^{(1)}, ..., \\mathbf A^{(M)}\\right\\}$ with $n$ nodes is $COSIE_{n,M}\\left(V, \\left\\{R^{(1)},...,R^{(M)}\\right\\}\\right)$ if each random network $\\mathbf A^{(m)}$ is $IER(P^{(m)})$. Stated another way, each of the $M$ random networks share the same orthonormal matrix $V$, but a unique score matrix $R^{(m)}$. This allows the random networks to share some underlying structure (which is conveyed by $V$) but each random network still has a combination of this shared structure (conveyed by $R^{(m)}$). \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the probability matrix $P^{(m)} = VR^{(m)}V^\\top$, you can see that two random networks with the same score matrix will be homogeneous (identically distributed), and two random networks with different score matrices will be heterogeneous (not identically distributed). In this way, you are able to capture the homogeneity between the random networks for Facebook and Twitter connections, while also capturing the heterogeneity between the random networks for Facebook and Linkedin connections.

    "## Correlated Network Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we get to a special case of network models, known as correlated network models. Let's say that you have a group of people in a city, and you know that each person in your group have both a Facebook and a Twitter account. The nodes in your network are the people who possess accounts. The first network consists of Facebook connections among the people, where an edge exists between two people if they are friends on Facebook. The second network consists of Twitter connections among the people, where an edge exists between two people if they follow one another on Twitter. You think that if two people are friends on Facebook, there is a good chance that they follow one another on Twitter, and vice versa. How do you reflect this similarity through a multiple network model?\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, network correlation between a pair of networks describes the property that the existence of edges in one network provides you with some level of information about edges in the other network, much like the Facebook/Twitter example that you just saw. In this book, we will focus on the $\\rho$-*correlated* network models. What the $\\rho$-correlated network models focus on is that given two random networks with the same number of nodes, each edge has a correlation of $\\rho$ between the two networks. To define this a little more rigorously, a pair of random networks $\\mathbf A^{(1)}$ and $\\mathbf A^{(2)}$ are called $\\rho$-**correlated** if all of the edges across both networks are mutually independent, except that for all pairs of indices $i$ and $j$, $corr(\\mathbf a_{ij}^{(1)}, \\mathbf a_{ij}^{(2)}) = \\rho$, where $corr(\\mathbf x, \\mathbf y)$ is the Pearson correlation between two random variables $\\mathbf x$ and $\\mathbf y$. In our example, this means that whether two people are friends on Facebook is *correlated* with whether they are following one another on Twitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, the Pearson correlation describes whether one variable being large/small gives information that the other variable is large/small (positive correlation, between $0$ and $1$) or whether one variable being large/small gives information that the other variable will be small/large (negative correlation, between $-1$ and $0$). If the two networks are positively correlated and you know that one of the edges $\\mathbf a_{ij}^{(1)}$ has a value of one, then you have information that $\\mathbf a_{ij}^{(2)}$ might also be one, and vice-versa for taking values of zero. If the two networks are negatively correlated and you know that one of the edges $\\mathbf a_{ij}^{(1)}$ has a value of one, then you have information that $\\mathbf a_{ij}^{(2)}$ might be zero, and vice-versa. If the two networks are not correlated ($\\rho = 0$) you do not learn anything about edges of network two by looking at edges from network one.\n",

    "### $\\rho$-Correlated RDPG\n",

    "The $\\rho$-correlated RDPG is the most general correlated network model you will need for the purposes of this book. Remembering that both ER and SBM random networks are special cases of the RDPG (for a given choice of the latent position matrix), the $\\rho$-correlated RDPG can therefore be used to construct $\\rho$-correlated ER and $\\rho$-correlated SBMs, too. The way you can think about the $\\rho$-correlated RDPG is that like for the normal RDPG, a latent position matrix $X$ with $n$ rows and a latent dimensionality of $d$ is used to define the edge-existence probabilities for the networks $\\mathbf A^{(1)}$ and $\\mathbf A^{(2)}$. We begin by defining that $\\mathbf A^{(1)}$ is $RDPG_n(X)$. Next, we define the second network as follows. We use a coin for each edge $(i, j)$, which has a probability that depends on the values that the first network takes. If the edge $\\mathbf a_{ij}^{(1)}$ takes the value of one, then we use a coin which has a probability of landing on heads of $\\vec x_i^\\top \\vec x_j + \\rho(1 - \\vec x_i^\\top \\vec x_j)$. If the edge $\\mathbf a_{ij}^{(1)}$ takes the value of zero, then we use a coin which has a probability of landing on heads of $(1 - \\rho)\\vec x_i^\\top \\vec x_j$. We flip this coin, and if it lands on heads, then the edge $\\mathbf a_{ij}^{(2)}$ takes the value of one. If it lands on tails, then the edge $\\mathbf a_{ij}^{(2)}$ takes the value of zero. If $\\mathbf A^{(1)}$ and $A^{(2)}$ are random networks which are $\\rho$-correlated RDPGs with latent position matrix $X$, we say that the pair $\\left\\{\\mathbf A^{(1)}, A^{(2)}\\right\\}$ are $\\rho-RDPG_n(X)$. \n",
