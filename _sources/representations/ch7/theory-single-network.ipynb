    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this section, there are some important background points you should be get some familiarity with. First, you should be readily familiar with all of the mathematical operations and concepts from probability and statistics which are explained directly in the [Terminology Section](#link?) of the book. We will introduce some of these background points, and the specific notations we will use for this section here. It is often the case that when you read probability or statistics books, that different instructors or professors will use different notations that will differ. We find these differences to be cumbersome, so we're going to hopefully outline most of the common ones that people have multiple notations for here. They are:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background in notation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extrapolatory ellipses: We might often summarize a sequence of natural numbers with ellipses; e.g., $\\{1, ..., n\\}$. All the ellipses mean is to just continue indexing in the meantime, until you reach the last index in the sequence. For instance, in the above sequence, the ellipses stand for $4$, $5$, $6$, ... all the way up to $n-1$. These ellipses have the same interpretation in either vectors or matrices; just continue the numbering pattern upwards basically.\n",
    "2. Shorthand for sequences of natural numbers: We will denote a sequence of natural numbers that goes from $1$ up to $n$ using the notation $[n]$. Stated another way, $[n] = \\{1, ..., n\\}$.\n",
    "3. Useful numerical spaces: We will often use a number of numerical spaces in this book. The common ones will tend to be accented with a double bold-faced print. They are the natural numbers (denoted $\\mathbb N$), the integers (denoted $\\mathbb Z$), the non-negative integers (denoted $\\mathbb Z_{\\geq 0}$), the positive integers (denoted $\\mathbb Z_+$), and the real numbers (denoted $\\mathbb R$). \n",
    "4. Shorthand for objects which can be (arbitrary) values from a particular numerical space: it will often be the case that in describing a network model, our description applies regardless of what the value is for a particular number in that description. For this reason, we tend to use notation to denote the arbitrariness of this choice. We will use the notation $x \\in \\mathcal S$ to denote that the value $x$ (which could be a scalar, a vector, or a matrix) has values which can be described by the numerical space captured by $\\mathcal S$. For instance, $x \\in \\mathbb R$ means that $x$ is an arbitrary real number. $\\vec x \\in \\mathbb R^d$ means that $\\vec x$ is an arbitrary vector with $d$ elements, where each element is an arbitrary real number; e.g., $x_i \\in \\mathbb R$. Another common vector representation we will see is $\\vec x \\in [K]^d$ or $\\vec x \\in \\{1,..., K\\}^d$, which in both cases, means that each element $x_i$ is an arbitrary natural number that is at most $K$. $X \\in \\mathbb R^{r \\times c}$ means that $X$ is an arbitrary vector with $r$ rows and $c$ columns, where each element is an arbitrary real number; e.g., $x_{ij} \\in \\mathbb R$.\n",
    "5. Vector in-line notation: with $\\vec x$ as a vector, we might sometimes resort to describing $\\vec x$ using an in-line notation which directly captures its dimensionality. We might say something like, $\\vec x = (x_i)_{i = 1}^d$, which just means that $\\vec x$ looks like this:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\vec x = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "        x_1 \\\\\n",
    "        x_2 \\\\\n",
    "        \\vdots \\\\\n",
    "        x_d\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "    This applies for the case where we are dealing with both scalar and random vectors.\n",
    "6. Matrix in-line notation: with $X$ as a matrix, we might similarly describe $X$ using in-line notation which captures its number of rows and columns, with something like $X = (x_{ij})_{i \\in [r], j \\in [c]}$ or $\\left((x_{ij})_{j = 1}^c\\right)_{i = 1}^r$. What this means is that we first \"unroll\" $X$ *across* the dimension being indexed by $j$ from $1$ to $c$, and then *down* the dimension being indexed by $i$ from $1$ to $r$. In this sense, $X$ would be a matrix with $r$ rows and $c$ columns. It would look like this:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    X &= \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "        x_{11} & ... & x_{1c} \\\\\n",
    "        \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n",
    "        x_{r1} & ... & x_{rc}\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background in probability distributions and distribution functions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Distribution functions for random variables: $\\mathbf x \\sim F$, which basically can be read as, the random variable (which is denoted with a bold-faced $\\mathbf x$) has a distribution which is delineated by the distribution function $F$.\" For instance, if $\\mathbf x \\sim Bern(p)$, this means that the random variable $\\mathbf x$ has a distribution which can be described by a Bernoulli random variable with probability $p$. In this case, what this means is that realizations of $\\mathbf x$, denoted by $x$ (no bold-face), are like a coin flip which lands on heads with probability $p$ and tails with probability $1 - p$, where \"heads\" is akin to $x$ having a value of $1$, and \"tails\" is akin to $x$ having a value of $0$. Stated mathematically:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    Pr(\\mathbf x = x) &= \\begin{cases}\n",
    "        p & x = 1 \\\\\n",
    "        1 - p & x = 0\n",
    "    \\end{cases}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "    + We believe that familiarity with the Bernoulli distribution with probability parameter $p$ denoted $Bern(p)$, the Categorical (Multinoulli) distribution with probability vector $\\vec p$, and the Uniform distribution $Unif(a, b)$ with a minimum at $a$ and a maximum at $b$ would be valuable to look at. If you are already familiar with these words but forget exactly what they mean, we will describe them in-line as necessary, as well.\n",
    "2. Distribution functions for random vectors: $\\mathbf {\\vec x} \\sim F$, which can be read as, \"the random vector $\\mathbf x$ has a distribution function which is delineated by the distribution function $F$\". In most cases, we will assume some level of statistical independence for random vectors, which basically means that instead of describing $\\mathbf{\\vec x}$ itself directly as having a distribution, we can for our purposes describe each individual element of $\\mathbf {\\vec x}$, written $\\mathbf x_i$, as having a distribution. This will reduce cumbersome descriptions of distribution functions for random vectors to simpler distributions functions for random variables.\n",
    "    + This brings us to an important aside. When we are working with vectors (either random or fixed), you might see us use the fancy word \"dimensions\" to describe individual elements of these vectors. The $i^{th}$ dimension of a scalar vector $\\vec x$ is just the $i^{th}$ element of that vector; e.g., $x_i$, which is a scalar. The $i^{th}$ dimension of a random vector $\\mathbf {\\vec x}$ is similar, where $\\mathbf x_i$ is a random variable.\n",
    "3. Distribution functions for random matrices: $\\mathbf X \\sim F$, which can be read as, \"the random matrix $\\mathbf x$ has a distribution function which is delineated by the distribution function $F$\". Here, we will also tend to assume statistical independence for random matrices, which again means that instead of describing $\\mathbf X$, we can just look at the individual elements of $\\mathbf X$, denoted $\\mathbf x_{ij}$, as having distributions. \n",
    "    + There is one important exception to this, which will arise for the *a posteriori* Random Dot Product Graph, which will use something called **inner-product distributions**. In this case, instead of describing $\\mathbf X$ itself, we will describe a family of distributions for random vectors, which comprise the rows of $\\mathbf X$. We will try our best to explain these in an intuitive way without going outside of the scope of a graduate understanding of statistics.\n",

    "To understand network models, it is crucial to understand the concept of a network as a random quantity, taking a probability distribution. We have a realization $A$, and we think that this realization is random in some way. Stated another way, we think that there exists a network-valued random variable $\\mathbf A$ that governs the realizations we get to see. Since $\\mathbf A$ is a random variable, we can describe it using a probability distribution. The distribution of the random network $\\mathbf A$ is the function $\\mathbb P$ which assigns probabilities to every possible configuration that $\\mathbf A$ could take. Notationally, we write that $\\mathbf A \\sim \\mathbb P$, which is read in words as \"the random network $\\mathbf A$ is distributed according to $\\mathbb P$.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "In the preceding description, we made a fairly substantial claim: $\\mathbb P$ assigns probabilities to every possible configuration that realizations of $\\mathbf A$, denoted by $A$, could take. How many possibilities are there for a network with $n$ nodes? Let's limit ourselves to simple networks: that is, $A$ takes values that are unweighted ($A$ is *binary*), undirected ($A$ is *symmetric*), and loopless ($A$ is *hollow*). In words, $\\mathcal A_n$ is the set of all possible adjacency matrices $A$ that correspond to simple networks with $n$ nodes. Stated another way: every $A$ that is found in $\\mathcal A$ is a *binary* $n \\times n$ matrix ($A \\in \\{0, 1\\}^{n \\times n}$), $A$ is symmetric ($A = A^\\top$), and $A$ is *hollow* ($diag(A) = 0$, or $A_{ii} = 0$ for all $i = 1,...,n$). We describe $\\mathcal A_n$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\mathcal A_n = \\left\\{A : A \\textrm{ is an $n \\times n$ matrix with $0$s and $1$s}, A\\textrm{ is symmetric}, A\\textrm{ is hollow}\\right\\}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize the statement that $\\mathbb P$ assigns probabilities to every possible configuration that realizations of $\\mathbf A$ can take, we write that $\\mathbb P : \\mathcal A_n \\rightarrow [0, 1]$. This means that for any $A \\in \\mathcal A_n$ which is a possible realization of a random network $\\mathbf A$, that $\\mathbb P(\\mathbf A = A)$ is a probability (it takes a value between $0$ and $1$). If it is completely unambiguous what the random variable $\\mathbf A$ refers to, we might abbreviate $\\mathbb P(\\mathbf A = A)$ with $\\mathbb P(A)$. This statement can alternatively be read that the probability that the random variable $\\mathbf A$ takes the value $A$ is $\\mathbb P(A)$. Finally, let's address that question we had in the previous paragraph. How many possible adjacency matrices are in $\\mathcal A_n$?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine what just one $A \\in \\mathcal A_n$ can look like. Note that each matrix $A$ has $n \\times n = n^2$ possible entries, in total, since $A$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix. There are $n$ possible self-loops for a network, but since $\\mathbf A$ is simple, it is loopless. This means that we can subtract $n$ possible edges from $n^2$, leaving us with $n^2 - n = n(n-1)$ possible edges that might not be unconnected. If we think in terms of a realization $A$, this means that we are ignoring the diagonal entries $a_{ii}$, for all $i \\in [n]$.  Remember that a simple network is also undirected. In terms of the realization $A$, this means that for every pair $i$ and $j$, that $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$. If we were to learn about an entry in the upper triangle of $A$ where $a_{ij}$ is such that $j > i$, note that we have also learned what $a_{ji}$ is, too. This symmetry of $A$ means that of the $n(n-1)$ entries that are not on the diagonal of $A$, we would, in fact, \"double count\" the possible number of unique values that $A$ could have. This means that $A$ has a total of $\\frac{1}{2}n(n - 1)$ possible entries which are *free*, which is equal to the expression $\\binom{n}{2}$. Finally, note that for each entry of $A$, that the adjacency can take one of two possible values: $0$ or $1$. To write this down formally, for every possible edge which is randomly determined, we have *two* possible values that edge could take. Let's think about building some intuition here:\n",
    "1. If $A$ is $2 \\times 2$, there are $\\binom{2}{2} = 1$ unique entry of $A$, which takes one of $2$ values. There are $2$ possible ways that $A$ could look:\n",

    "        0 & 0\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "2. If $A$ is $3 \\times 3$, there are $\\binom{3}{2} = \\frac{3 \\times 2}{2} = 3$ unique entries of $A$, each of which takes one of $2$ values. There are $8$ possible ways that $A$ could look:\n",

    "How do we generalize this to an arbitrary choice of $n$? The answer is to use *combinatorics*. Basically, the approach is to look at each entry of $A$ which can take different values, and multiply the total number of possibilities by $2$ for every element which can take different values. Stated another way, if there are $2$ choices for each one of $x$ possible items, we have $2^x$ possible ways in which we could select those $x$ items. But we already know how many different elements there are in $A$, so we are ready to come up with an expression for the number. In total, there are $2^{\\binom n 2}$ unique adjacency matrices in $\\mathcal A_n$. Stated another way, the *cardinality* of $\\mathcal A_n$, described by the expression $|\\mathcal A_n|$, is $2^{\\binom n 2}$. The **cardinality** here just means the number of elements that the set $\\mathcal A_n$ contains. When $n$ is just $15$, note that $\\left|\\mathcal A_{15}\\right| = 2^{\\binom{15}{2}} = 2^{105}$, which when expressed as a power of $10$, is more than $10^{30}$ possible networks that can be realized with just $15$ nodes! As $n$ increases, how many unique possible networks are there? In the below figure, look at the value of $|\\mathcal A_n| = 2^{\\binom n 2}$ as a function of $n$. As we can see, as $n$ gets big, $|\\mathcal A_n|$ grows really really fast!"

    "So, now we know that we have probability distributions on networks, and a set $\\mathcal A_n$ which defines all of the adjacency matrices that every probability distribution must assign a probability to. Now, just what is a network model? A **network model** is a set $\\mathcal P$ of probability distributions on $\\mathcal A_n$. Stated another way, we can describe $\\mathcal P$ to be:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\mathcal P &\\subseteq \\{\\mathbb P: \\mathbb P\\textrm{ is a probability distribution on }\\mathcal A_n\\}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we will simplify $\\mathcal P$ through something called *parametrization*. We define $\\Theta$ to be the set of all possible parameters of the random network model, and $\\theta \\in \\Theta$ is a particular parameter choice that governs the parameters of a specific network-valued random variaable $\\mathbf A$. In this case, we will write $\\mathcal P$ as the set:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\mathcal P(\\Theta) &= \\left\\{\\mathbb P_\\theta : \\theta \\in \\Theta\\right\\}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "If $\\mathbf A$ is a random network that follows a network model, we will write that $\\mathbf A \\sim \\mathbb P_\\theta$, for some choice $\\theta$. We will often use the shorthand $\\mathbf A \\sim \\mathbb P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are used to traditional univariate or multivariate statistical modelling, an extremely natural choice for when you have a discrete sample space (like $\\mathcal A_n$, which is discrete because we can count it) would be to use a categorical model. In the categorical model, we would have a single parameter for all possible configurations of an $n$-node network; that is, $|\\theta| = \\left|\\mathcal A_n\\right| = 2^{\\binom n 2}$. What is wrong with this model? The limitations are two-fold:\n",
    "1. As we explained previously, when $n$ is just $15$, we would need over $10^{30}$ bits of storage just to define $\\theta$. This amounts to more than $10^{8}$ zetabytes, which exceeds the storage capacity of *the entire world*.\n",
    "2. With a single network observed (or really, any number of networks we could collect in the real world) we would never be able to get a reasonable estimate of $2^{\\binom n 2}$ parameters for any reasonably non-trivial number of nodes $n$. For the case of one observed network $A$, an estimate of $\\theta$ (referred to as $\\hat\\theta$) would simply be for $\\hat\\theta$ to have a $1$ in the entry corresponding to our observed network, and a $0$ everywhere else. Inferentially, this would imply that the network-valued random variable $\\mathbf A$ which governs realizations $A$ is deterministic, even if this is not the case. Even if we collected potentially *many* observed networks, we would still (with very high probability) just get $\\hat \\theta$ as a series of point masses on the observed networks we see, and $0$s everywhere else. This would mean our parameter estimates $\\hat\\theta$ would not generalize to new observations at *all*, with high probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what are some more reasonable descriptions of $\\mathcal P$? We explore some choices below. Particularly, we will be most interested in the *independent-edge* networks. These are the families of networks in which the generative procedure which governs the random networks assume that the edges of the network are generated *independently*. **Statistical Independence** is a property which greatly simplifies many of the modelling assumptions which are crucial for proper estimation and rigorous statistical inference, which we will learn more about in the later chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equivalence Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of the below models, we will explore the concept of the **probability equivalence class**, or an *equivalence class*, for short. The probability is a function which in general, describes how effective a particular observation can be described by a random variable $\\mathbf A$ with parameters $\\theta$, written $\\mathbf A \\sim F(\\theta)$. The probability will be used to describe the probability $\\mathbb P_\\theta(\\mathbf A)$ of observing the realization $A$ if the underlying random variable $\\mathbf A$ has parameters $\\theta$.  Why does this matter when it comes to equivalence classes? An equivalence class is a subset of the sample space $E \\subseteq \\mathcal A_n$, which has the following properties. Holding the parameters $\\theta$ fixed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If $A$ and $A'$ are members of the same equivalence class $E$ (written $A, A' \\in E$), then $\\mathbb P_\\theta(A) = \\mathbb P_\\theta(A')$. \n",
    "2. If $A$ and $A''$ are members of different equivalence classes; that is, $A \\in E$ and $A'' \\in E'$ where $E, E'$ are equivalence classes, then $\\mathbb P_\\theta(A) \\neq \\mathbb P_\\theta(A'')$.\n",
    "3. Using points 1 and 2, we can establish that if $E$ and $E'$ are two different equivalence classes, then $E \\cap E' = \\varnothing$. That is, the equivalence classes are **mutually disjoint**.\n",
    "4. We can use the preceding properties to deduce that given the sample space $\\mathcal A_n$ and a probability function $\\mathbb P_\\theta$, we can define a partition of the sample space into equivalence classes $E_i$, where $i \\in \\mathcal I$ is an arbitrary indexing set. A **partition** of $\\mathcal A_n$ is a sequence of sets which are mutually disjoint, and whose union is the whole space. That is, $\\bigcup_{i \\in \\mathcal I} E_i = \\mathcal A_n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will see more below about how the equivalence classes come into play with network models, and in a later section, we will see their relevance to the estimation of the parameters $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(representations:whyuse:networkmodels:iern)=\n",
    "### Independent-Edge Random Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The below models are all special families of something called **independent-edge random networks**. An independent-edge random network is a network-valued random variable, in which the collection of edges are all independent. In words, this means that for every adjacency $\\mathbf a_{ij}$ of the network-valued random variable $\\mathbf A$, that $\\mathbf a_{ij}$ is independent of $\\mathbf a_{i'j'}$, any time that $(i,j) \\neq (i',j')$. When the networks are simple, the easiest thing to do is to assume that each edge $(i,j)$ is connected with some probability (which might be different for each edge) $p_{ij}$. We use the $ij$ subscript to denote that this probability is not necessarily the same for each edge. This simple model can be described as $\\mathbf a_{ij}$ has the distribution $Bern(p_{ij})$, for every $j > i$, and is independent of every other edge in $\\mathbf A$. We only look at the entries $j > i$, since our networks are simple. This means that knowing a realization of $\\mathbf a_{ij}$ also gives us the realizaaion of $\\mathbf a_{ji}$ (and thus $\\mathbf a_{ji}$ is a *deterministic* function of $\\mathbf a_{ij}$). Further, we know that the random network is loopless, which means that every $\\mathbf a_{ii} = 0$. We will call the matrix $P = (p_{ij})$ the **probability matrix** of the network-valued random variable $\\mathbf A$. In general, we will see a common theme for the probabilities of a realization $A$ of a network-valued random variable $\\mathbf A$, which is that it will greatly simplify our computation. Remember that if $\\mathbf x$ and $\\mathbf y$ are binary variables which are independent, that $\\mathbb P(\\mathbf x = x, \\mathbf y = y) = \\mathbb P(\\mathbf x = x) \\mathbb P(\\mathbf y = y)$. Using this fact:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\mathbb P(\\mathbf A = A) &= \\mathbb P(\\mathbf a_{11} = a_{11}, \\mathbf a_{12} = a_{12}, ..., \\mathbf a_{nn} = a_{nn}) \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\mathbb P(\\mathbf a_{ij} = a_{ij} \\text{ for all }j > i) \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\prod_{j > i}\\mathbb P(\\mathbf a_{ij} = a_{ij}), \\;\\;\\;\\;\\textrm{Independence Assumption}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Next, we will use the fact that if a random variable $\\mathbf a_{ij}$ has the Bernoulli distribution with probability $p_{ij}$, that $\\mathbb P(\\mathbf a_{ij} = a_{ij}) = p_{ij}^{a_{ij}}(1 - p_{ij})^{1 - p_{ij}}$:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\mathbb P_\\theta(A) &= \\prod_{j > i}p_{ij}^{a_{ij}}(1 - p_{ij})^{1 - p_{ij}}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've specified a probability and a very generalizable model, we've learned the full story behind network models and are ready to skip to estimating parameters, right? *Wrong!* Unfortunately, if we tried too estimate anything about each $p_{ij}$ individually, we would obtain that $p_{ij} = a_{ij}$ if we only have one realization $A$. Even if we had many realizations of $\\mathbf A$, this still would not be very interesting, since we have a *lot* of $p_{ij}$s to estimate, and we've ignored any sort of structural model that might give us deeper insight into $\\mathbf A$. In the below sections, we will learn successively less restrictive (and hence, *more expressive*) assumptions about $p_{ij}$s, which will allow us to convey fairly complex random networks, but *still* enable us with plenty of intteresting things to learn about later on."

    "From here on out, when we talk about an Erd&ouml;s R&eacute;nyi random variable, we will simply call it an ER network. In an ER network, each pair of nodes is connected with probability $p$, and therefore not connected with probability $1-p$. Statistically, we say that for each edge $\\mathbf{a}_{ij}$ for every pair of nodes where $j > i$ (in terms of the adjacency matrix, this means all of the edges in the *upper right* triangle), that $\\mathbf{a}_{ij}$ is sampled independently and identically from a *Bernoulli* distribution with probability $p$. The word \"independent\" means that edges in the network occurring or not occurring do not affect one another. For instance, this means that if we knew a student named Alice was friends with Bob, and Alice was also friends with Chadwick, that we do not learn any information about whether Bob is friends with Chadwick. The word \"identical\" means that every edge in the network has the same probability $p$ of being connected. If Alice and Bob are friends with probability $p$, then Alice and Chadwick are friends with probability $p$, too. We assume here that the networks are undirected, which means that if an edge $\\mathbf a_{ij}$ exists from node $i$ to $j$, then the edge $\\mathbf a_{ji}$ also exists from node $j$ to node $i$. We also assume that the networks are loopless, which means that no edges $\\mathbf a_{ii}$ can go from node $i$ to itself. If $\\mathbf A$ is the adjacency matrix for an ER network with probability $p$, we write that $\\mathbf A \\sim ER_n(p)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's formalize an example of one of the limitations of an ER random network. Remember that we said that ER random networks are often too simple. Well, one way in which they are simple is called **degree homogeneity**, which is a property in which *all* of the nodes in an ER network have the *exact* same expected node degree! What this means is that if we were to take an ER random network $\\mathbf A$, we would expect that *all* of the nodes in the network had the same degree. Let's see how this works:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Working Out the Expected Degree in an Erd&ouml;s-R&eacute;nyi Network\n",
    "Suppose that $\\mathbf A$ is a simple network which is random. The network has $n$ nodes $\\mathcal V = (v_i)_{i = 1}^n$. Recall that the in a simple network, the node degree is $deg(v_i) = \\sum_{j = 1}^n \\mathbf a_{ij}$. What is the expected degree of a node $v_i$ of a random network $\\mathbf A$ which is Erd&ouml;s-R&eacute;nyi?\n",

    "To describe this, we will compute the expectated value of the degree $deg(v_i)$, written $\\mathbb E\\left[deg(v_i)\\right]$. Let's see what happens:\n",

    "    &= \\sum_{j = 1}^n \\mathbb E[\\mathbf a_{ij}]\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "We use the *linearity of expectation* in the line above, which means that the expectation of a sum with a finite number of terms being summed over ($n$, in this case) is the sum of the expectations. Finally, by definition, all of the edges $A_{ij}$ have the same distribution: $Bern(p)$. The expected value of a random quantity which takes a Bernoulli distribution is just the probability $p$. This means every term $\\mathbb E[\\mathbf a_{ij}] = p$. Therefore:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\mathbb E\\left[deg(v_i)\\right] &= \\sum_{j = 1}^n p = n\\cdot p\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Since all of the $n$ terms being summed have the same expected value. This holds for *every* node $v_i$, which means that the expected degree of all nodes is an undirected ER network is the same number, $n \\cdot p$.\n",

    "## Network Models for networks which aren't simple\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the discussions a little more easy to handle, in the above descriptions and all our successive descriptions, we will describe network models for **simple networks**. To recap, networks which are simple are binary networks which are both loopless and undirected. Stated another way, simple networks are networks whose adjacency matrices are only $0$s and $1$s, they are hollow (the diagonal is entirely *0*), and symmetric (the lower and right triangles of the adjacency matrix are the *same*). What happens our networks don't quite look this way?\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we'll keep the assumption that the networks are binary, but we will discuss non-binary network models in a later chapter. We have three possibilities we can consider, and we will show how the \"relaxations\" of the assumptions change a description of a network model. A *relaxation*, in statistician speak, means that we are taking the assumptions that we had (in this case, that the networks are *simple*), and progressively making the assumptions weaker (more *relaxed*) so that they apply to other networks, too. We split these out so we can be as clear as possible about how the generative model changes with each relaxation step.\n",

If we have a pair of nodes and know which of the $K$ communities each node is from, the block matrix tells us the probability that those two nodes are connected. If our networks are simple, the matrix $B$ is also symmetric, which means that if $b_{kk'} = p$ where $p$ is a probability, that $b_{k'k} = p$, too. The requirement of $B$ to be symmetric exists *only* if we are dealing with undirected networks.\n",

Intuitionally what we want to reflect is, if we know that node $i$ is in community $k'$ and node $j$ is in community $k$, that the $(k', k)$ entry of the block matrix is the probability that $i$ and $j$ are connected.

    "\n",
    "Let's think back to our school example for the Stochastic Block Model. Remember, we had 100 students, each of whom could go to one of two possible schools: school one or school two. Our network had 100 nodes, representing each of the students. We said that the school for which each student attended was represented by their node assignment $\\tau_i$ to one of two possible communities. The matrix $B$ was the block probaability matrix, where $b_{11}$ was the probability that students in school one were friends, $b_{22}$ was the probability that students in school two were friends, and $b_{12} = b_{21}$ was the probability that students were friends if they did not go to the same school. In this case, we said that $\\mathbf A$ was an $SBM_n(\\tau, B)$ random network. \n",

    "When would this setup not make sense? Let's say that Alice and Bob both go to the same school, but Alice is more popular than Bob. In general since Alice is more popular than Bob, we might want to say that for any clasasmate, Alice gets an additional \"popularity benefit\" to her probability of being friends with the other classmate, and Bob gets an \"unpopularity penalty.\" The problem here is that within a single community of an SBM, the SBM assumes that the **node degree** (the number of nodes each nodes is connected to) is the *same* for all nodes within a single community. This means that we would be unable to reflect this benefit/penalty system to Alice and Bob, since each student will have the same number of friends, on average. This problem is referred to as **community degree homogeneity** in a Stochastic Block Model Network. Community degree homogeneity just means that the node degree is *homogeneous*, or the same, for all nodes within a community.\n",

We will refer to the subset of the possible real vectors as $\\mathcal X_K$, which we learned about above. This means that for any $\\vec x_i, \\vec x_j$ that are in $\\mathcal X_K$, it is always the case that $\\vec x_i^\\top \\vec x_j$ is between $0$ and $1$.

Well, $p_{ji} = \\vec x_j^\\top \\vec x_i$, which is exactly the same as $p_{ij}$! This means that even if we were to consider a directed RDPG, the probabilities that can be captured are *always* going to be symmetric. The generalized random dot product graph, or GRDPG, relaxes this assumption. This is achieved by using *two* latent positin matrices, $X$ and $Y$, and letting $P = X Y^\\top$.
