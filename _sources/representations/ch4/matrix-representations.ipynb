    "When we work with networks, we need a way to represent them mathematically and in our code. A network itself lives in network space, which is just the set of all possible networks. Network space is kind of abstract and inconvenient if we want to use traditional mathematics, so we'd generally like to *represent* networks with groups of numbers to make everything more concrete.\n",

So we make a square matrix $A$, with $n$ rows and $n$ columns, so that each node has its own row and column associated to it. The idea is that the value on the $i_{th}$ row and the $j_{th}$ column of $A$ will be a 1 if there is an edge between nodes $i$ and $j$, and a 0 otherwise. \n",

    "So, let's fill out the matrix. Start with the first row, which corresponds to the first node, and move along the columns. If there is an edge between the first node and the column you're at, put a 1 in the current location. If the two nodes aren't connected, add a 0. When you're done with the first row, move on to the second. Keep going until the whole matrix is filled with 0's and 1's. \n",
