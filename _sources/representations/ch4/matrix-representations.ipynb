    "Throughout this book, the beating heart of matrix representations of networks that we will see is the adjacency matrix. The idea is pretty straightforward: Let's say you have a network with $n$ nodes. You give each node an index -- usually some value between 0 and n -- and then you create an $n \\times n$ matrix. If there is an edge between node $i$ and node $j$, you fill the $(i, j)_{th}$ value of the matrix with an entry, usually $1$ if your network has unweighted edges. In the case of undirected networks, you end up with a symmetric matrix with full of 1's and 0's, which completely represents the topology of your network.\n",

    "### The regularized Laplacian\n",
    "\n",
    "The regularized Laplacian is an adaptation of the `DAD` Laplacian you learned about in the previous section. As it turns out, when networks have degree matrices where some of the degrees are really, really small, the *spectral clustering* approach you will learn about in {ref}`ch6:lse` is simply not going to perform very well. When we say it is not going to perform very well, what we mean is that the spectral clusterings are going to be extremely influenced by these nodes with really small node degrees. To overcome this hurdle, instead of using the `DAD` Laplacian, you can use the regularized Laplacian, defined extremely similarly to the `DAD` Laplacian, as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    L^{rDAD}(\\tau) &= D_\\tau^{-\\frac{1}{2}}A D_\\tau^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\tau$ is a regularization constant which is greater than or equal to zero, and $D_\\tau = D + \\tau I$. When we put $\\tau$ in parentheses here (that is, $(\\tau)$), all that we mean is that $L^{rDAD}$ is a function of the particular regularization constant that you choose. Basically, what this is going to do is just \"inflate\" the diagonal elements of the degree matrix. So, if the degree for some of the nodes is extremely small, when we add a constant $\\tau$ to them, we can increase the degrees by $\\tau$. In effect, what this will do is make the nodes with really small degrees (which, like we said, might cause issues in the spectral clustering) a lot less impactful on the results that you obtain. Also, as you can see, if $\\tau = 0$, then $L^{rDAD}(\\tau) = L^{DAD}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at what $L^{rDAD}(\\tau)$ and $L^{DAD}$ look like when we pick $\\tau$ to be $1$. You can do this in `graspologic` using `form=\"R-DAD\"`, and then setting `regularizer` appropriately:"
