An **edge-weight** $w(i,j)$ assigns a weight to an edge between nodes $i$ and $j$ if that edge exists. If we care about weightedness in the network, the network is called *weighted*. The adjacencies $a_{ij}$ of $A$ for a weighted network take the value of the edge-weight; that is, $a_{ij} = w_{ij}$ for any edge which exists between nodes $i$ and $j$. In the below plot, edge-weight indicates the approximate time to travel from one borough to the other. The network is undirected, so we don't have to worry about directionality differences.

In terms of the adjacency matrix, two nodes $i$ and $j$ are adjacent/neighbors if the element $a_{ij}$ has a value of one. For instance, in the New York City example, the nodes SI and BK are adjacent/neighbors due to the presence of the green edge, shown in the figure. A related property is known as *incidence*. A node $i$ is **incident** an edge $(i, j)$ or an edge $(j,i)$ if it is one of the two nodes which the edge connects. The adjacencies corresponding to this edge, $a_{ij}$ and $a_{ji}$, will both take a value of one.

If an edge does not exist, the adjacency corresponding to this *potential* edge takes a value of zero.

For instance, if we consider the node BK in our example, we have two incident edges, indicated in green, so $degree(v_{BK}) = 2$. When we look at the corresponding adjacency matrix, if we sum the adjacencies for node $v_{BK}$, we also get two.

    "## Network summary statistics tell us useful attributes about networks\n",
    "\n",
    "When we learn about networks, it is often valuable to compute properties of the network so that we can get a better understanding of the relationships within it. We will caall these properties *network summary statistics*. Although this book will focus more on finding and using *representations* of networks than using summary statistics, they're useful to know about. We will introduce two network summary statistics, the network density and the clustering coefficient, and then show an example as to why we do not find summary statistics all that useful for network machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The network density indicates the fraction of possible edges which exist\n",
    "\n",
    "Given athe adjacency matrix $A$ of a simple network, what fraction of the possible edges *actually* exist? \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this quantity, first we need to understand how many edges are possible in a network. We have $n$ total nodes in the network, so $A$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix. Therefore, $A$ has $n^2$ total entries. However, it turns out that over *half* of these entries are redundant. Since we said that the network was loopless, this means that every entry is *by default* $0$ along the diagonal. Since each node $i$ has a corresponding diagonal entry $a_{ii}$, this comes to $n$ entries in total that we do not need to count. This leaves our total possible number of edges at $n^2$ (the total number of entries in the matrix $A$) minus $n$ (the total number of entries which are automatically $0$), or $n^2 - n = n(n - 1)$. This quantity represents the total number of possible edges which are *not* in the diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "What else are we overcounting? Well, as it turns out, since the network is also *undirected*, every node that is *not* in the diagonal is also being double counted. Why is this? Remember that an undirected network has an adjacency matrix where for every pair of nodes $i$ and $j$, $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$. This means that we overcount the number of possible edges not in the diagonal by a factor of *two*, since each off-diagonal entry $a_{ij}$ has a corresponding entry $a_{ji}$. This leaves the total number of possible edges in the network as $\\frac{1}{2}n(n - 1)$, or the total number of possible edges not in the diagonal reduced by a factor of two. This quantity is equivalent to the notation $\\binom n 2$, which is read as \"$n$ *choose* $2$\". You might see this notation arise in the study of *combinatorics*, where it is used to answer the question of, \"In how many ways can we *choose* two items from $n$ items?\" In the network below, we see all of the *possible* edges indicated in red. If you count them up, there are $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 5 \\cdot (5 - 1) = 10$ red edges, in total:"

Remember that $A$ is loopless, so we don't need to count the diagonal entries at all. This brings our quantity to $\\sum_{i = 1}^n \\sum_{i \\neq j}a_{ij}$, since we don't need to count any edges along the diagonal of $A$. Next, remember that if an edge in $A$ exists between nodes $i$ and $j$, that *both* $a_{ij}$ and $a_{ji}$ take the value of $1$, due to the undirected property. This means that to obtain the edge count of $A$, that we only need to count *either* $a_{ij}$ *or* $a_{ji}$. Somewhat arbitrarily in this book, we will always count the adjacencies $a_{ij}$ in the upper triangle of $A$, which are the entries where $j > i$.

In our example, there are six closed triplets amongst the nodes {BX, MH, Q}, and there are twele open triplets across {BK, MH, Q} and {BK, MH, BX}.

Note that if a triplet between nodes $i$, $j$, and $k$ is closed, then all three of the adjacenies $a_{ij}$, $a_{jk}$, and $a_{ki}$ have a value of $1$. Therefore, if we could the number of times that $a_{ij}a_{jk}a_{ki} = 1$, we also count the number of closed triplets! This means that the number of closed triplets can be expressed as $\\sum_{i,j,k}a_{ij}a_{jk}a_{ki}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Further, note that for a given node $i$, that we can find an arbitrary triplet (either open or closed) through the following procedure.\n",
    "1. Pick a single neighbor $j$ for node $i$. Note that the node $i$ has a number of neighbors equal to $degree(v_i) = d_i$, so there are $d_i$ possible neighbors to choose from.\n",
    "2. Pick a different neighbor $k$ for node $i$. Note that since node $i$ had $d_i$ neighbors, it has $d_i - 1$ neighbors that are not node $j$.\n",
    "3. Since we know that nodes $j$ and $k$ are both neighbors of node $i$, we know that $a_{ij}$ and $a_{ik}$ both have values of one, and therefore the edges $(i, j)$ and $(i, k)$ exist. Therefore, the tuple of nodes $(i, j, k)$ is a triplet, because *at least* two edges exist amongst the three nodes. This tuple is closed if the edge $(j, k)$ exists, and open if the edge $(j, k)$ does not exist.\n",

Therefore, the number of open and closed triplets in the network is the quantity $\\sum_i d_i (d_i - 1)$.  Then we could express the clustering coefficient in terms of the adjacency matrix as:\n",
