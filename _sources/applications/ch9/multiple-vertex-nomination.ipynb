    "To do this, we're going to turn to a classic example: school networks. First, you have the friends lists of 50 students from a popular social networking site. For any two individual students in the school, there is a probability of $0.5$ that they are friends on the social networking site. \n",
    "\n",
    "Separately, you also conduct a survey of the students at the school. The nodes are the 50 students students from the school. You poll the 50 students, and ask them who their friends are. For any given pair of students, an edge exists if either of the two students listed they were friends with the other. As it turns out, whether people are friends in real life is highly correlated with whether they are friends on the social network, so you think it seems reasonable to model these two networks as $\\rho$-$ER_{50}(p)$ networks. For your purposes, just pick $p=0.5$ so you can generate some simulated data, and $\\rho = 0.8$ (high correlation).\n",

Given a student for whom you have their corresponding friends list for, can you identify the corresponding node or nodes in the second network (the self-reported survey) that these results correspond to? We'll start back with the permutation code and in the previous section on [graph matching](#link?):"

This problem is different from the vertex nomination problem because the nominees are nodes from the self-reported survey network, and *not* from the social networking friends list network.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem looks like the [seeded graph matching problem](#link?), too, which you just learned about in the preceding section. This is because you have two networks (the social networking friends list network and the self-reported friend survey network), and you know a *node correspondance* for 5 of the nodes in the network (the 5 students you still have the names of). This problem is different from the seeded graph matching problem because don't necessarily need to match the whole network, you just want to find candidate nodes for a small subset of nodes in the network.\n",

    "The soft seeded graph matching algorithm (`SoftSGM`) is a slight modification of the `SGM` algorithm you learned about previously. Instead of computing *one* graph matching, with soft seeded graph matching, you compute *many*. You do this by running `SGM` whatever number of times you want, exactly like you did previously, but the key is you use *different* starting positions. If we remember from the last section, the `SGM` and `GM` algorithms were run using gradient descent, and the key is that gradient descent will tend towards *good* solutions, but not necessarily the global *best* solutions. This means that for each different starting position, you might end up with a similar graph matching between your two networks, but not necessarily *identical*. You run `SoftSGM` as follows:\n",

    "Given a network $A^{(1)}$ with $n_1$ nodes, a network $A^{(2)}$ with $n_2$ nodes, and a number of repetitions $R$, you take the following procedure:\n",
    "1. For $r$ in $1:R$:\n",
    "    + Run $SGM(A^{(1)}, A^{(2)})$, with or without padding, and with or without seeds, with a random starting point.\n",
    "    + If node $i$ maps to node $j$ in the resulting graph matching, let $p_{ij}^{(r)} = 1$. If node $i$ is not mapped to node $j$ in the resulting graph matching, let $p_{ij}^{(r)} = 0$.\n",
    "2. For every node $i$ in network $A^{(1)}$ and every node $j$ in network $A^{(2)}$, let $p_{ij} = \\frac{1}{R} \\sum_{r = 1}^R p_{ij}^{(r)}$ be the fraction of times that node $i$ is mapped to node $j$ across all $R$ graph matchings.\n",

This will lead to $p_{ij}$ tending to have a higher value. On the other hand, if a node $i$ in $A^{(1)}$ is very dissimilar from a node $j$ in network $A^{(2)}$, then few or even no matchings will produce a matching in which $p_{ij}^{(r)}$ is one.

To start, you need to define a node of interest, or a vertex of interest (VOI), which is the node which you will look for the best nominees for in your social network. To do this, let's pick one of the nodes from your social network which is not a seed chosen in the network, and take a look at which node should have a high score in the nomination list (its *correct* match):"
