    "You work at Facebook and Twitter, but there’s been a terrible incident on the Twitter end. All Twitter users’ names and handles have been somehow been deleted! Your bosses are furious and have tasked you with somehow recovering the lost information. How might you go about doing this? Luckily, you’ve been working hard and have somehow earned yourself this dual Facebook/Twitter gig, so you have a great resource at your disposal: the Facebook social network. You know all facebook users and who they are friends with, and since you’ve only lost the twitter usernames, you can still figure out which unnamed twitter users follow each other. You decide to use the Facebook network connectivity data to re-label the twitter social network. Alternatively, you can say the we are “aligning” Twitter based on Facebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the two social networks above, each user is a node and an edge exists if two users are friends. We'll define the facebook and twitter networks as $F$ and $T$ respectively, with associated adjacency matrices $A_F$ and $A_T$. Aligning the nodes of two networks is known as *Graph Matching*, because we are matching the node indices of one network (or, *graph*) to another. This can also be thought of as a mapping; that is, based on the neighbors of a node in $F$, you find a node in $T$ with the most similar neighborhood structure, then give the two nodes the same index. In other words, one of our Twitter users will be assigned the user name of the Facebook user with the most connections in common. This is done for the whole network, with the end result being that overall the structure is best preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a ton of ways to match the nodes of two networks. In fact, for network pairs with $n$ nodes, there are $n!$ possible mappings; for example, when $n=100$, there are more than $10^{157}$ possible matchings. So how would we go about figuring out which mapping is best without the computationally gargantuan task of checking each one? First, we need a metric that tells us how similar two networks are to each other. For graph matching, this similarity metric is defined as $f(A, B) = ||A - B||_F^2$ for unweighted adjacency matrices $A$ and $B$. This quantity is known as the squared *Frobenius norm* (hence the subscript $F$) of the difference between $A$ and $B$. In other words, $f(A, B)$ is the sum of the squared elementwise differences between $A$ and $B$, or the quantity:\n",

A gradient can be thought of as a vector valued slope; it is simply the slope of a function in all of it's dimensions, at a single point in space. Gradient Descent is a very common optimization method using to find optimal solutions for a wide range of problems. \n",

The ball rolls down hill until it comes to a stop; once it stops, we know we've found the lowest point. Gradient descent works in a similar way, taking steps in the direction of the local gradient with respect to some parameter. Once the gradient is zero, a local minimum has been found and the algorithm is stopped.\n",

    "As mentioned previously, as networks become larger, they quickly become more difficult to match. One method to mitigate this difficulty is to use $\\textit{seeds}$. Seeds are a subset of matches that we already know before we perform the graph matching. For example, if we are given two networks $T$ and $F$ with 300 nodes each, we might already know ten node matches between $T$ and $F$. Having this prior information greatly improves our ability to match the networks. "

    "## Seeded Graph Matching on Correlated Network Pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the effectiveness of Seeded Graph Matching (`SGM`), the algorithm will be applied on a pair of correlated SBM networks (undirected, no self loops), which is a simpler adaptation of the $\\rho$-correlated $RDPG$ which we learned about in [Chapter 5](#link?). Like the $\\rho$-correlated $RDPG$, the idea here is that we have two normal SBMs, but for any edge in the two networks $\\mathbf a_{ij}^{(1)}$ and $\\mathbf a_{ij}^{(2)}$, they will be correlated with correlation $\\rho$. In words, if $\\rho$ is positive, then if we know that $\\mathbf a_{ij}^{(1)}$ has a value of one, then we have information to suggest that $\\mathbf a_{ij}^{(2)}$ might be one too. In this case, we will have that $\\mathbf A_1$ and $\\mathbf A_2$ are $\\rho-SBM_n(\\vec z, B)$ where the networks are highly correlated, and $\\rho = 0.9$. The block matrix is:\n",
