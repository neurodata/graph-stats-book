    "You work at Facebook and Twitter, but there’s been a terrible incident. All twitter users’ names and handles have been somehow been deleted! Your bosses are furious and have tasked you with somehow recovering the lost information. How might you go about doing this? Luckily, you’ve been working hard and have somehow earned yourself this dual Facebook/Twitter gig, so you have a great resource at your disposal: the Facebook social network. You know all facebook users and who they are friends with, and since you’ve only lost the twitter usernames, you can still figure out which ghost-users follow each other (make this sentence more specific, split it up into more sentences). You decide to use the Facebook network connectivity data to re-label the twitter social network. Alternatively, you can say the we are “aligning” Twitter based on Facebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the social networks are represented with each user as a node, and an edge exists if two users are friends. We'll define the facebook and twitter networks as $F$ and $T$ respectively, with associated adjacency matrices $A_F$ and $A_T$. This method is known as $\\textit{Graph Matching}$, because we are matching the node labels of one graph to another. This can also be thought of as a mapping; that is, based on the neighborhood structure of a node in the $F$ network, we assign the same label to the node in $T$ with the most similar structure. In other words, one of our twitter users will be assigned the user name of the Facebook user with the most followers in common. This is then done for the whole network, such that overall the structure is best preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can imagine, there are a very large number of these possible mappings. In fact, for network pairs with $n$ nodes, there are $n!$ possible mappings. So how would we go about solving this(more specific) mathematically? First, we need a metric that tells us how similar two networks are to each other. For graph matching, this similarity metric is defined as $f(A, B) = ||A - B||_F^2$ for unweighted adjacency matrices $A, B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$. In other words, $f(A, B)$ is the sum of the squared elementwise differences between $A$ and $B$. To understand this functionally, consider the best possible case where $A=B$, that is, the networks are identical. The difference will be a matrix of all zeros, and taking the squared norm will then yield $f(A,B) = 0$. If we remove one edge from $A$, then $f(A,B) = 1$. If we consider the worst possible case (every edge in $A$ does not exist in $B$, and vice versa), then $f(A,B) = n^2$. This metric effectively counts the number of adjacnecy disagreements between $A$ and $B$. Thus, we want to find the mapping where $f(A, B)$ is as small as possible.\n"
