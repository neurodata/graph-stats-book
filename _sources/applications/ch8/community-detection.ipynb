Unfortunately, we have skipped a relatively fundamental problem with SBM parameter estimation. You will notice that everything we have covered about the SBM to date assumes that we the assignments to one of $K$ possible communities for each node, which is given by the node assignment variable $z_i$ for each node in the network. Why is this problematic? Well, quite simply, when we are learning about *many* different networks we might come across, we might not actually *observe* the communities of each node.\n",

What do we mean by this? What we mean is that, while looking at a single edge in our network, we only have two possible choices: the edge exists or it does not exist. However, if we instead consider nodes in *relation* to one another, we can start to deduce patterns about how our nodes might be organized in the community sense. While seeing that two students Bill and Stephanie were friends will not tell us whether Bill and Stephanie were in the same school, if we knew that Bill and Stephanie also shared many other friends (such as Denise, Albert, and Kwan), and those friends also tended to be friends, that piece of information might tell us that they all might happen to be school mates. \n",

The spectral embeddings will help us to identify these communities of nodes, and hopefully, when we review the communities of nodes we learn, we will be able to derive some sort of insight. For instance, in our school example, ideally, we might pick up on two communities of nodes, one for each school.

In a pairs plot, we investigate how effectively the embedding \"separates\" nodes within the dataset into individual \"clusters\". We will ultimately exploit these \"clusters\" that appear in the latent positions to generate community assignments for each node. To demonstrate the case where the \"pairs plot\" shows obvious latent community structure, we will use the predicted latent position matrix we just produced, from an adjacency matrix which is a realization of a random network which is truly a Stochastic Block Model.

Stated another way, the off-diagonal plot is a scatter plot for each node of the $k^{th}$ dimension and the $l^{th}$ dimension of the latent position matrix.
