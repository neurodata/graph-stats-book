    "There is a particular type of sea slug which has gills on the outside of its body. When you squirt water at these gills, they withdraw into the slug. The interesting thing about this type of slug is that the brain network involved in this gill withdrawal reflex is entirely mapped out, from the neurons which detect and transmit information about the water into the slug's brain, to the neurons that leave the brain and fire at its muscles. (For those interested, this is a real thing - look up Eric Kandel's research on Aplysia!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you're a researcher studying these sea slugs, and you have a bunch of brain networks of the same slug. We can define each node as a single neuron, and edges denote connections between neurons. Each of the brain networks that you have were taken at different time points: some before water started getting squirted at the slug's gills, and some as the water was getting squirted. Your goal is to reconstruct when water started to get squirted, using only the networks themselves. You hypothesize that there should be some signal change in your networks which can tell you the particular time at which water started getting squirted. Given the network data you have, how do you figure out which timepoints these are?\n",
    "\n",
    "The broader class of problems this question addresses is called *anomaly detection*. The idea, in general, is that you have a bunch of snapshots of the same network over time. Although the nodes are the same, the edges are changing at each time point. Your goal is to figure out which time points correspond to the most change, either in the entire network or in particular groups of nodes. You can think of a network as \"anomalous\" with respect to time if some potentially small group of nodes within the network concurrently changes behavior at some point in time compared to the recent past, while the remaining nodes continue with whatever noisy, normal behavior they had.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, what we would really like to do is separate the signal from the noise. All of the nodes in the network are likely changing a bit over time, since there is some variability intrinsic in the system. Random noise might just dictate that some edges get randomly deleted and some get randomly created at each step. We want to figure out if there are timepoints where the change isn't just random noise: we're trying to figure out a point in time where the probability distribution that the network *itself* is generated from changes.\n",

    "It's time to start thinking about how we'd approach figuring out which of the time points are anomalies. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simplest approaches to this problem might just be to figure out which node has the highest count of edge changes across your timeseries. For each node across the timeseries, you'd count the number of new edges that appeared (compared to the previous point in time), and the number of existing edges that were deleted. Whichever count is highest could be your anomalous node.\n",
    "\n",
    "This might give you a rough estimate -- and you could even potentially find perturbed time points with this approach -- but it's not necessarily the best solution. Counting edges doesn't account for other important pieces of information: for instance, you might be interested in which other nodes new edges were formed with. It seems like deleting or creating edges with more important nodes, for instance, should be weighted higher than deleting or creating edges with unimportant nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's try another method. You might actually be able to guess it! The idea will be to simply estimate each network's latent positions, followed by a hypothesis testing approach. Here's the idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's call the latent positions for our network $X^{(t)}$ for the snapshot of the network at time $t$. You're trying to find specific time points, $X^{(i)}$, which are different from their previous time point $X^{(i-1)}$ by a large margin. You can define \"different\" as \"difference in matrix norm\". Remember that the matrix norm is just a number that generalizes the concept of vector magnitude to matrices. In other words, We're trying to find a time point where the difference in norm between the latent positions at time $t$ and the latent positions at time $t-1$ is greater than some constant:  $||X^{(t)} - X^{(t-1)}|| > c$. The idea is that non-anomalous time points will probably be a bit different, but that the difference will be within some reasonable range of variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's an alternate problem where you restrict your view to *nodes* rather than entire adjacency matrices. The idea is that you'd find time-points which are anomalous for particular nodes or groups of nodes, rather than the entire network. The general idea is the same: you find latent positions, then test for how big the difference is between time point $t$ and time point $t-1$. This time, however, your test is for particular nodes. You want to figure out if $||X_i^{(t)} - X_i^{(t-1)}|| > c$, where you're looking at a particular latent position $X_i$ rather than all of them at once. We'll be focusing on the problem for whole networks, but you can take a look at the original paper if you're curious about how to apply it to nodes."

    "We'll start with the first time point, which (because we generated the data!) we know in advance is not an anomaly.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to just estimate the latent positions for each timepoint separately with ASE or LSE, we'd run into the nonidentifiability problem that we've seen a few times over the course of this book: The latent positions would be rotated versions of each other, and we'd have to use something like Procrustes (which adds variance, since it's just an estimate) to rotate them back into the same space.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since we have multiple time points, each of which is associated to an adjacency matrix, it's natural to use models from the Multiple-Network Representation Learning section (You can go back and read chapter 6.7 if you're fuzzy on the details here). In that section, we introduced the Omnibus Embedding as a way to estimate latent positions for multiple *networks* simultaneously, but all we really need for it is multiple *adjacency matrices*. These exist in our network in the form of its multiple time points; So, we'll just embed multiple time points at once with the Omnibus Embedding, and then they'll live in the same space.\n",
    "\n",
    "We only really *need* to embed two time points at a time, since all we really care about is being able to directly compare a time point $X^{(t)}$ and the point prior to it $X^{(t-1)} = Y$ - but because of the way Omni works, we'll get smaller-variance estimates if we embed all the time points at once. Embedding them all at once also to be more robust to embedding dimension in practice. If you wanted to save computational power - for instance, if you had a lot of time points - you could instead choose to embed subsets of them, or just the two you'll actually be using.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, here's what's going on in the code below:\n",
    "1. We embed the time points using OMNI and then get our estimates for the first two sets of latent positions $\\hat{X} = \\hat{X}^{(t)}$ and $\\hat{Y} = \\hat{X}^{(t-1)}$.\n",
    "2. Then, we get the norm of their difference $||\\hat{X} - \\hat{Y}||$ with numpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important point to clarify is that there are a lot of different types of matrix norms: Frobenius norm, spectral norm, and so on. In our case, we'll be using the $l_2$ operator norm, which is simply the largest singular value of the matrix. The `ord` parameter argument in numpy determines which norm we use, and `ord=2` is the operator norm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this norm, intuitively, will tell us how different two matrices are. If the norm of the difference between the true latent positions $X - Y$ is small, then $X$ and $Y$ are very similar matrices; whereas if the norm of $X - Y$ is large, then $X$ and $Y$ are very different. The norm should be large for anomalies, and small for everything else."
