    "This book assumes you know next to nothing about how networks can be viewed as a statistical object. Its goal is to give you the concepts, the intuitions, and the tools you need to actually implement programs capable of learning from network data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The book is intended to give you the best introduction you can possibly get to learn about how networks can be used to explore data. You might be a graduate student, doing research on biochemical networks or trade networks in ancient Mesopotamia. Or you might be a professional interested in an introduction to the field of network data science, because you think it might be useful for your company. Whoever you are, we think you'll find a lot of things that are useful and interesting in this book!\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll cover the fundamentals of network data science, focusing on developing intuition on networks as statistical objects, doing so while paired with relevant Python tutorials. By the end of this book, you will be able to utilize efficient and easy to use tools available for performing analyses on networks. You will also have a whole new range of statistical techniques in your toolbox, such as representations, models, and algorithms for networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll spend this book learning about network algorithms by showing how they're implemented in production-ready Python frameworks:\n",
    "- Numpy and Scipy are used for scientific programming. They give you access to array objects, which are the main way we'll represent networks.\n",
    "- Scikit-Learn is very easy to use, yet it implements many Machine Learning algorithms efficiently, so it makes for a great entry point to learn Machine Learning.\n",
    "- Graspologic is an open-source Python package developed by Microsoft and Johns Hopkins University which gives you utilities and algorithms for doing statistical analyses on network-valued data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The book favors a hands-on approach, growing an intuitive understanding of\n",
    "networks through concrete working examples and a bit of theory.\n",
    "While you can read this book without picking up your laptop, we highly recommend\n",
    "you experiment with the code examples available online as Jupyter notebooks at http://docs.neurodata.io/graph-stats-book/intro.html."

    "This book is organized into three parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Part I, Foundations, gives you a brief overview of the kinds of things you'll be doing in this book, and shows you how to solve a network data science problem from start to finish. It covers the following topics:\n",
    "- What a network is and where you can find networks in the wild\n",
    "- All the reasons why you should care about studying networks\n",
    "- Examples of ways you could apply network data science to your own projects\n",
    "- An overview of the types of problems Network Machine Learning is good at dealing with\n",
    "- The main challenges you'd encounter if you explored Network Learning more deeply\n",
    "- Exploring a real network data science dataset, to get a broad understanding of what you might be able to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part II, Representations, is all about how we can represent networks statistically, and what we can do with those representations. It covers the following topics:\n",
    "- Ways you can represent individual networks\n",
    "- Ways you can represent groups of networks\n",
    "- The various useful properties different types of networks have\n",
    "- Types of network representation models and why they're useful\n",
    "- How to represent networks as lower-dimensional embeddings\n",
    "- Types of learning you can do on representations of multiple networks\n",
    "- Types of learning when you have extra information about your networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Part III, Applications, is about using the representations you learned about in the previous part to learn about your networks. It covers the following topics:\n",
    "- Figuring out if communities in your networks are different from each other\n",
    "- Selecting the right model to represent your data\n",
    "- Finding nodes in your networks that are interesting\n",
    "- Finding edges in your networks that are interesting\n",
    "- Finding communities in your networks that are interesting\n",
    "- Finding nodes or edges which are anomalies in a particular network\n",
    "- Detecting networks which are anomalies when you have a group of networks\n",
    "- What to do when you have new data after you've already trained a network model\n",
    "- How hypothesis testing works on networks\n",
    "- Pairing nodes that represent the same thing between two networks"
