    "\n",
    "The *a priori* SBM is an SBM in which we know ahead of time (*a priori*) which nodes are in which communities. Here, we will use the variable $K$ to denote the maximum number of different communities. The ordering of the communities does not matter; the community we call $1$ versus $2$ versus $K$ is largely a symbolic distinction (the only thing that matters is that they are *different*). The *a priori* SBM has the following parameter:\n",

    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| $B$ | [0,1]$^{K \\times K}$ | The block matrix, which assigns edge probabilities for pairs of communities |\n",
    "\n",
    "To describe the *A Priori* SBM, we will designate the community each node is a part of using a vector, which has a single community assignment for each node in the network. We will call this **node assignment vector** $\\vec{\\tau}$, and it is a $n$-length vector (one element for each node) with elements which can take values from $1$ to $K$. In symbols, we would say that $\\vec\\tau \\in \\{1, ..., K\\}^n$. What this means is that for a given element of $\\vec \\tau$, $\\tau_i$, that $\\tau_i$ is the community assignment (either $1$, $2$, so on and so forth up to $K$) for the $i^{th}$ node. If there we hahd an example where there were $2$ communities ($K = 2$) for instance, and the first two nodes are in community $1$ and the second two in community $2$, then $\\vec\\tau$ would be a vector which looks like:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\vec\\tau &= \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 & 2 & 2\\end{bmatrix}^\\top\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's discuss the matrix $B$, which is known as the **block matrix** of the SBM. We write down that $B \\in [0, 1]^{K \\times K}$, which means that the block matrix is a matrix with $K$ rows and $K$ columns. If we have a pair of nodes and know which of the $K$ communities each node is from, the block matrix tells us the probability that those two nodes are connected. If our networks are simple, the matrix $B$ is also symmetric, which means that if $b_{kk'} = p$ where $p$ is a probability, that $b_{k'k} = p$, too. The requirement of $B$ to be symmetric exists *only* if we are dealing with undirected networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let's think about how to write down the generative model for the *a priori* SBM. Intuitionally what we want to reflect is, if we know that node $i$ is in community $k'$ and node $j$ is in community $k$, that the $(k', k)$ entry of the block matrix is the probability that $i$ and $j$ are connected. We say that given  $\\tau_i = k'$ and $\\tau_j = k$, $\\mathbf a_{ij}$ is sampled independently from a $Bern(b_{k' k})$ distribution for all $j > i$. Note that the adjacencies $\\mathbf a_{ij}$ are not *necessarily* identically distributed, because the probability depends on the community of edge $(i,j)$. If $\\mathbf A$ is an *a priori* SBM network with parameter $B$, and $\\vec{\\tau}$ is a realization of the node-assignment vector, we write that $\\mathbf A \\sim SBM_{n,\\vec \\tau}(B)$.\n",

    "### Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "What does the probability for the *a priori* SBM look like? In our previous description, we admittedly simplified things to an extent to keep the wording down. In truth, we model the *a priori* SBM using a *latent variable* model, which means that the node assignment vector, $\\vec{\\pmb \\tau}$, is treated as *random*. For the case of the *a priori* SBM, it just so happens that we *know* the specific value that this latent variable $\\vec{\\pmb \\tau}$ takes, $\\vec \\tau$, ahead of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, since $\\vec \\tau$ is a *parameter* of the *a priori* SBM, the probability is a bit simpler than for the *a posteriori* SBM. This is because the *a posteriori* SBM requires an integration over potential realizations of $\\vec{\\pmb \\tau}$, whereas the *a priori* SBM does not, since we already know that $\\vec{\\pmb \\tau}$ was realized as $\\vec\\tau$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting these steps together gives us that:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "Pr_\\theta(A) &= Pr_{\\theta}(\\mathbf A = A | \\vec{\\pmb \\tau} = \\vec\\tau) \\\\\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, for the *a priori* SBM, we know that each edge $\\mathbf a_{ij}$ only *actually* depends on the community assignments of nodes $i$ and $j$, so we know that $Pr_{\\theta}(\\mathbf a_{ij} = a_{ij} | \\vec{\\pmb \\tau} = \\vec\\tau) = Pr(\\mathbf a_{ij} = a_{ij} | \\tau_i = k', \\tau_j = k)$, where $k$ and $k'$ are any of the $K$ possible communities. This is because the community assignments of nodes that are not nodes $i$ and $j$ do not matter for edge $ij$, due to the independence assumption. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's think about the probability matrix $P = (p_{ij})$ for the *a priori* SBM. We know that, given that $\\tau_i = k'$ and $\\tau_j = k$,  each adjacency $\\mathbf a_{ij}$ is sampled independently and identically from a $Bern(b_{k',k})$ distribution. This means that $p_{ij} = b_{k',k}$. Completing our analysis from above:\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $n_{k' k}$ denotes the total number of edges possible between nodes assigned to community $k'$ and nodes assigned to community $k$. That is, $n_{k' k} = \\sum_{j > i} \\mathbb 1_{\\tau_i = k'}\\mathbb 1_{\\tau_j = k}$. Further, we will use $m_{k' k}$ to denote the total number of edges observed between these two communities. That is, $m_{k' k} = \\sum_{j > i}\\mathbb 1_{\\tau_i = k'}\\mathbb 1_{\\tau_j = k}a_{ij}$. Note that for a single $(k',k)$ community pair, that the probability is analogous to the probability of a realization of an ER random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--- We can formalize this a bit more explicitly. If we let $A^{\\ell k}$ be defined as the subgraph *induced* by the edges incident nodes in community $\\ell$ and those in community $k$, then we can say that $A^{\\ell k}$ is a directed ER random network, --->\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the ER model, there are again equivalence classes of the sample space $\\mathcal A_n$ in terms of their probability. For a two-community setting, with $\\vec \\tau$ and $B$ given, the equivalence classes are the sets:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    E_{a,b,c}(\\vec \\tau, B) &= \\left\\{A \\in \\mathcal A_n : m_{11} = a, m_{21}=m_{12} = b, m_{22} = c\\right\\}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",

    "## *A Posteriori* Stochastic Block Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In the *a posteriori* Stochastic Block Model (SBM), we consider that node assignment to one of $K$ communities is a random variable, that we *don't* know already like te *a priori* SBM. We're going to see a funky word come up, that you're probably not familiar with, the **$K$ probability simplex**. What the heck is a probability simplex?\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition for a simplex is probably something you're very familiar with, but just haven't seen a word describe. Let's say I have a vector, $\\vec\\pi = (\\pi_k)_{k \\in [K]}$, which has a total of $K$ elements. $\\vec\\pi$ will be a vector, which indicates the *probability* that a given node is assigned to each of our $K$ communities, so we need to impose some additional constraints. Symbolically, we would say that, for all $i$, and for all $k$:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\pi_k = Pr(\\pmb\\tau_i = k)\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "The $\\vec \\pi$ we're going to use has a very special property: all of its elements are non-negative: for all $\\pi_k$, $\\pi_k \\geq 0$. This makes sense since $\\pi_k$ is being used to represent the probability of a node $i$ being in group $k$, so it certainly can't be negative. Further, there's another thing that we want our $\\vec\\pi$ to have: in order for each element $\\pi_k$ to indicate the probability of something to be assigned to $k$, we need all of the $\\pi_k$s to sum up to one. This is because of something called the Law of Total Probability. If we have $K$ total values that $\\pmb \\tau_i$ could take, then it is the case that:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\sum_{k=1}^K Pr(\\pmb \\tau_i = k) = \\sum_{k = 1}^K \\pi_k = 1\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "So, back to our question: how does a probability simplex fit in? Well, the $K$ probability simplex describes all of the possible values that our vector $\\vec\\pi$ could take! In symbols, the $K$ probability simplex is:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\left\\{\\vec\\pi : \\text{for all $k$ }\\pi_k \\geq 0, \\sum_{k = 1}^K \\pi_k = 1 \\right\\}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "So the $K$ probability simplex is just the space for all possible vectors which could indicate assignment probabilities to one of $K$ communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does the probability simplex look like? Below, we take a look at the $2$-probability simplex (2-d $\\vec\\pi$s) and the $3$-probability simplex (3-dimensional $\\vec\\pi$s):"

Our network had 100 nodes, representing each of the students. We said that the school for which each student attended was represented by their node assignment $\\tau_i$ to one of two possible communities. The matrix $B$ was the block probaability matrix, where $b_{11}$ was the probability that students in school one were friends, $b_{22}$ was the probability that students in school two were friends, and $b_{12} = b_{21}$ was the probability that students were friends if they did not go to the same school.

    "Finally, let's think about how to write down the generative model for the *a priori* DCSBM. We say that $\\tau_i = k'$ and $\\tau_j = k$, $\\mathbf a_{ij}$ is sampled independently from a $Bern(\\theta_i \\theta_j b_{k'k})$ distribution for all $j > i$. As we can see, $\\theta_i$ in a sense is \"correcting\" the probabilities of each adjacency to node $i$ to be higher, or lower, depending on the value of $\\theta_i$ that that which is given by the block probabilities $b_{\\ell k}$. If $\\mathbf A$ is an *a priori* DCSBM network with parameters and $B$, we write that $\\mathbf A \\sim DCSBM_{n,\\vec\\tau}(\\vec \\theta, B)$."
