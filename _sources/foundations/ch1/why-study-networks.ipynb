    "When you start thinking about it, you can seeing networks everywhere. The objects could be people, and their relationship could be friendships. Or they could be computers, and the relationship could be the information they send to each other. You'd have warehouse networks if you're working in logistics, where the relationships are products traveling between warehouses; or if you're an epidemiologist studying disease, you could create an infection network. Neuroscientists can explore brain networks, which tell them about neurons and their relationships with each other, and computer scientists often use neural networks, which have become pillars in machine learning.\n",

    "How do networks fit into the world of machine learning, and why are they important? What does it mean to learn from a network, and what kinds of things would you be trying to learn? How can we use network-valued data to understand the world better?\n",
    "\n",
    "Networks can even be used to visualize ideas: in a Bayesian network, your nodes represent a set of variables and the relationship between them is their conditional dependencies. You can have ecological networks, electrical networks, gene networks, and you could visualize your team's workflow with a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even the way we think is organized as a network. Visualize a concept or object in your head. Maybe you could think about the food you had for breakfast this morning, or the city you live in. Now, think about the connections between those concepts and others. Maybe you had eggs and toast for breakfast. Eggs and toast are connected with a multitude of other concepts in your head: forks and silverware, kitchens, hunger, protein, carbohydrates, your morning routine, chickens, wheat, other breakfast foods, and an innumerable amount of other things. What you're doing right now is exploring a small part of the massive semantic network that lives in your head.\n",

    "Networks have been thought about in one form or another since the 1700's, when Leonhard Euler kickstarted the field with a famous problem about bridges in a city called called KÃ¶nigsberg. One crucially influential use of networks was in 1996, when a graduate student at Stanford named Larry Page made the PageRank algorithm. The idea was that websites on the internet (which, in 1996, had barely formed) could be ordered into a hierarchy by \"link popularity\": a web page would rank higher the more links there were to it. Larry Page and his friend Sergey Brin realized that PageRank could be used to create a search engine -- and so they used the PageRank algorithm to found a small web searching company they called Google. Other companies formed early on - in particular companies like Twitter or LinkedIn, whose products are social networks - have spurred a great deal of interest in network science in the past twenty years. Because our world is becoming more interconnected, and because more network data exists now than ever in the past, now is an incredibly good time to learn about networks and their role in machine learning.\n"
