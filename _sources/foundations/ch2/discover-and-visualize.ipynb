    "So this is rather striking: without knowing *anything* about the nodes of the brain, and *only* using the connectivity patterns in the brain, it turns out that what we found somewhat resembles the lobe orientation of the brain. Notice that the nodes in the back of the brain tend to all be a similar color, which are the nodes that fall into the occipital lobe. Next, we can see there is another relatively homogeneous group of nodes in the  middle/top of the brain, which represents the nodes in the parietal lobe. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, back to what we actually found. As you will learn in the section on [mase embedding](ch6:multinet:mase), the mase embedding followed by clustering tends to find groups of nodes that have similar connectivity patterns in the connectomes. This means that the nodes tend to behave \"as a unit\", if you will, in that they tend to be active/inactive together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking these conclusions together, we find that some areas of the brain (such as the occipital and parietal areas) feature nodes which are both functionally *and* spatially similar: they tend to show similar connectivity patterns with respect to other groups of nodes in the network, *and* are in similar spatial positions in the brain. On the other hand, for other areas of the brain, while the nodes may be functionally similar, they might not necessarily be spatially similar. This is where the domain expertise kicks in: we don't know how to interpret this particular aspect of our finding, but maybe you or your colleagues do!\n",

    "And this is where the fun of network machine learning comes into play: it is a tool not only to *apply* algorithms to data, but to facilitate *learning new things* about that data as well. You might get some predictable conclusions (such as some of the nodes being both functionally and spatially similar), and you might get some unpredictable conclusions (such as some of the nodes being functionally, but *not* spatially, similar). Your ability to understand network machine learning, while crucial, is going to go *hand in hand* with your ability to understand the intricacies of the domain you want to apply network machine learning to. We hope that we can help with the former part; we'll leave the latter to you!"

While what we did in this chapter was relatively straightforward, the process from obtaining your data to choosing appropriate network machine learning problems can be extremely arduous!
