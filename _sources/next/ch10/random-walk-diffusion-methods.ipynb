    "Although this book puts a heavy emphasis on spectral methods, there are many ways in which you can learn lower-dimensional representations for networks which don't involve spectral approaches. As opposed to spectral methods, a **random walk on a network** is a random process which focuses on the analysis of paths which start at a node in the network, and proceed to generate successions of random steps to other nodes in the network. The manner in which these random processes materialize is a function of the topology of the random network, including the nodes, edges, and (optionally, if the network is weighted), the edge weights. \n",

    "## A simplified first-order random walk on a network\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, let's consider an extremely simplified approach for a first-order random walk on the network that you saw back in [properties of networks](ch4:prop-net), which was our New York example. To begin, let's redefine the nodes and edges of the network. The nodes of the network are the five boroughs of New York City (Staten Island SI, Brooklyn BK, Queens Q, the Bronx BX, and Manhattan MH). The nodes in your network are the five boroughs. The edges $(i,j)$ of your network exist if one can travel from borough $i$ to borough $j$ along a bridge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you will look at a map of New York City, with the bridges connecting the different boroughs. In the middle, you look at this map as a network layout plot. The arrows indicate the direction of travel. On the right, you look at this map as an adjacency matrix:"

    "You are staying at a hotel which is located in Manhattan, and you decide that you are going to explore the city as follows. When you are in a given borough $i$, you will determine the next borough you will explore by letting random chance do the work for you. To better define a first-order random walk, we need to introduce a background concept first: the Markov chain and the Markov property. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Markov chains and the markov property\n",
    "\n",
    "A **finite-space markov chain** is a model of a random system in which we have a sequence of possible events which can occur which are *finite* (the boroughs we will visit on a day $t$) in which the probability of each event depends *only* on the event in which you were previously. For network analysis, we only need to think about *finite-space* Markov chains, because the network has a *finite* collection of possible events which can occur (the nodes in the network being visited). To put this down quantitatively, the markov chain is represented by the sequence $\\mathbf s_0, \\mathbf s_1, \\mathbf s_2, ...$, where each $\\mathbf s_t$ takes the value of one of the $n$ total nodes in the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice that in our definition of the finite-space markov chain, we made a disclaimer: the probability of each event depends *only* on the state in which we were previously. This is called the **markov property**. The idea is that, if we were in Manhattan at the previous step in time $t - 1$ (e.g., $\\mathbf s_{t-1}$ realized the value $v_{MH}$, or $\\mathbf s_{t-1} = v_{MH}$ for short), that if our current step in the Markov Chain were Brooklyn ($\\mathbf s_t = v_{BK}$), that the next step in the Markov chain would not depend *at all* on the fact that we already saw Manhattan. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### First-order random walks on a network as a markov chain\n",
    "\n",
    "To exhibit the ideas of a markov chain, we'll define a first-order random walk on your New York Boroughs. Remember that the borough you are at, $i$, has $d_i$ possible neighboring boroughs, where $d_i$ was the *degree* of node $i$. You will visit one of the other nodes in the network as follows. If borough $j$ is a neighbor of borough $i$ (an edge exists from borough $i$ to borough $j$), you will visit borough $j$ with probability $\\frac{1}{d_i}$. The idea is that you will visit neighbors of each borough at random, depending only on whether you can get to that borough along an edge of the network. This is called a **first-order random walk** because it is a random walk where you *ignore* everything about the path you have taken to get to your current *borough* to date, except for the fact that you are at that borough *now*. This means that your next borough will not depend *at all* on whether you have already been to that borough in your exploration of the city. If the node is not a neighbor of your current borough, you will visit it with probability $0$. Stated another way, if you are in node $i$, the probability of going to another node $j$ is defined as:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    p_{ij} &= \\begin{cases}\n",
    "        \\frac{1}{d_i}  & \\text{edge $(i,j)$ exists} \\\\\n",
    "        0  & \\text{edge $(i,j)$ does not exist}\n",
    "    \\end{cases}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Note that these probabilities, called the **transition probability** from node $i$ to node $j$, do not have *anything* to do with which nodes we have visited yet, and these transition probabilities are *always the same*! For this reason, they are often organized into a matrix, called the **transition probability matrix** $P$. In this case, the transition probability matrix looks like this:"

The transition probabilities are defined using the indexed *triplet* $p_{s_{t-1}ij}(p,q)$, where $s_{t-1}$ is the preceding node we visited, $i$ is the current node we are at, $j$ is any other node in the network, and $p$ and $q$ are the return and in-out parameters respectively.

    "\n",
    "Now that we know about second-order biased random walks, we are ready to approach our problem at hand: leveraging random walks to produce structured embeddings. We have one final ingredient to embed our networks: the `word2vec` algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Word2vec\n",
    "\n",
    "The `word2vec` algorithm is a technique for natural language processing (NLP) developed in 2013 by a team of researchers at Google led by Tomas Mikolov. The algorithm takes in large collections of text data, called a *corpus*. The algorithm takes this *corpus* of text along with a desired number of embedding dimensions $d$, and embeds every possible word in the corpus into a $d$-dimensional space such that the *contexts* of the words frequently used together are preserved. In this case, a *context* refers to words which tend to convey similar meaning (they are synonyms), words which tend to precede be used together (for instance, \"learning\" and \"intelligence\"), and many other attributes of the words. When we say \"preserved\", what we mean is that words that have similar contexts tend to be closer together in the embedded space. This embedding can then be used for many things, such as guessing the synonyms of words, suggesting next words for a sentence, and many other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't go into too many details here, because the procedure for `word2vec` requires some heavy background in neural networks which we'll learn in a much more general context about in the next section when we cover [Graph Neural Networks](#link?). If you want to learn more about `word2vec`, we would suggest you dig up some blog posts on sites like medium, or by checking out the original papers by Mikolov and his team, of which the first can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781) and the second can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4546).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using node2vec to embed the network\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin the `node2vec` procedure, we take our collection of nodes and the desired number of embedding dimensions $d$. Then, for each node, we generate a random walk of length $T$ using the given node as the starting node with parameters $(p,q)$, as we did above. This gives us a collection of random walks with disparate starting nodes in the network. We repeat this procedure a number of times for each possible starting node. Next, we \"pretend\" that node names are words, and we simply feed the collections of random walks we generated into `word2vec` algorithm as our \"corpus\" of text along with the desired number of embedding dimensions $d$. This produces for us a structured $d$-dimensional embedding of each node in the network. Nodes which tend to be along random walks together tend to end up closer in the embedding space, and nodes which do not tend to be along random walks together tend to end up further in the embedding space. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try embedding an SBM using `node2vec`. We're going to leave the in-out and return parameters both equal to one, for now; e.g., $p = q = 1$. We will generate $20$ random walks starting at each node ($w = 20$), and each walk will have a length of $200$ steps ($T = 200$). The network is going to be the same network we used from the section on the [Two-Truths Phenomenon](#link?), and we show the probability matrix on the left with a realization on the right:"

This is because the biases all turn out to be one, so the \"bias factors\" turn out to really just be the first-order transition probabilities from the normal random walk. So why do we want the flexibility of the second-order biased random walk, if we can embed our network using the first-order random walk?\n",

You will notice that since the `node2vec` procedure relies on the \"corpus\" of random walks, that the behavior of these random walks will have a *substantial* influence on the resulting embedding. Let's see what happens to our embeddings as we tend to favor moving within the same nodes for our random walks more, which means punishing in-out movements ($q$ is larger, so let's use $q=5$) and up-weighting return movements ($p$ is smaller, so let's use $p = 0.2$):"
