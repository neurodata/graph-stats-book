<h2>The network machine learning earthquake<a class="headerlink" href="#the-network-machine-learning-earthquake" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>In the early 1990s, a young Computer Science PhD student at Stanford University began thinking about themes for his doctoral thesis, a work which summarizes one’s contributions as a PhD student and contextualizes the research output produced during one’s tenure. Page had recently become enamored by the internet, and decided to focus on the interconnectedness of the world wide web, which has since become the backbone of the modern internet.</p>
<p>With the assistance of a fellow colleague, Sergey Brin, Page determined that the complicated set of links between documents on the world wide web could best be understood as a large <em>network</em>, in which the objects on the world wide web (documents) were interconnected through a series of links. These links were simply computer items which allow one to “jump” from one document to the next in a sequential fashion. The number of documents which linked to a reference document, Page and Brin theorized, gave some notion of the “popularity”, or the <em>page rank</em> of the document. Being out-of-the-box thinkers, Page and Brin took this idea and combined it with many other strategies: in particular, they developed a query system which allowed a sentence to be parsed into keywords, and then they developed an indexing system which mapped these keywords to the pages with the highest pagerank. After publishing several papers and getting a number of other computer scientists involved in the project, Page and Brin developed a prototype of the Google search Engine in 1998, and shortly thereafter, founded Google Inc. From there, the rest is history.</p>
<p>Fast forward over two decades, and networks have become a dominant data structure with which to understand many of the concepts of every day life. Social networks have led to a new rise in the interconnectedness of people, led by massive multi-billion dollar corporations such as Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Instagram, Douyin (TikTok), and WeChat. The economy forms a global interconnected trade network, wherein companies and countries interact with one another for daily commercial benefits. The Earth’s food chain forms an ecological network, in which plants and animals fight for survival in an unforgiving world. Neurons of the brain form an interconnected web of axons and synapses, together producing unique aspects about what make you really you.</p>

<h2>Network Machine learning in your projects<a class="headerlink" href="#network-machine-learning-in-your-projects" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Recent developments in network science have produced new strategies with which you can hope to understand and derive insights from this pervasive way to understand the world.</p>
<p>Perhaps you’re a researcher and you want to expose shadowy financial networks and corporate fraud? Or create a network framework for measuring teamwork in healthcare? Maybe you’re interested in ecological releationships between different animals, or maybe you want to model communities of neurons in the brain?</p>
<p>Or maybe you’re a data scientist and your company has tons of data (user logs, financial data, production data, machine sensor data, hotline stats, HR reports, etc.), and more than likely you could
view the data as a network and unearth some hidden gems of knowledge if you just knew where to look? For example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Using customers and items as the nodes of a network, purchases as the edges between a customer and an item, and the number of purchases as edge-weights, you can explore the purchasing habits of the most active customers in a purchasing network.</p></li>
<li><p>With the nodes as employees and the edges as whether a pair of employees have worked on a project together, you can explore patterns of collaboration within your company.</p></li>
<li><p>With the nodes as purchasing  and selling entities, such as customers or distributors, the edges as purchases between pairs of entities, and the edges as the size of a purchase, you can detect anomalous transactions to detect corporate fraud.</p></li>
<li><p>With the nodes as members of the supply chain, such as mining and transportation companies, and the edges as the paths through which production flows, you can develop transportation infrastructure to determine how to optimally disseminate production.</p></li>
<li><p>With the nodes as employees, edges as team co-assignment between employees, and node covariates as employee performance, you can isolate groups within your company which are over or underperforming employee expectations.</p></li>
<li><p>With the nodes as regions of the brain, the edges as whether two regions of the brain communicate, and network-level covariates as to whether or not each brain represents an individual with a mental health disorder, you can determine subsets of nodes which are most impacted by psychiatric illness.</p></li>
<li><p>…And many more!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever the reason, you have decided to explore and exploit networks and implement their analysis in your projects. Great idea!</p>

<h2>Objective and approach<a class="headerlink" href="#objective-and-approach" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>This book assumes you know next to nothing about how you can explore and exploit network data. Its goal is to give you the concepts, the intuitions, and the tools you need to actually implement programs capable of learning from network data.</p>
<p>The book is intended to give you the best introduction you can possibly get to explore and exploit network data. You might be a graduate student, doing research on biochemical networks or trade networks in ancient Mesopotamia. Or you might be a professional interested in an introduction to the field of network machine learning, because you think it might be useful for your company. Whoever you are, we think you’ll find a lot of things that are useful and interesting in this book!</p>

<p><span class="caption-number">Fig. 2 </span><span class="caption-text">Broadly, we think that the techniques developed and described in this book fall somewhere in the middle of this Venn Diagram. You will learn how to incorporate techniques from statistical learning and data science with network data.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#this-book" title="Permalink to this image">#</a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We’ll cover the fundamentals of network machine learning, focusing on developing intuition on networks, doing so while paired with relevant Python tutorials. By the end of this book, you will be able to utilize efficient and easy-to-use tools available for performing analyses on networks. You will also have a whole new range of techniques in your toolbox, such as representations, theory, and algorithms for networks.</p>
<p>We’ll spend this book learning about network algorithms by showing how they’re implemented in production-ready Python frameworks:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">numpy</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scipy</span></code> are used for scientific programming. They give you access to array objects, which are the main way we’ll represent networks computationally.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sklearn</span></code> is very easy-to-use, yet it implements many machine learning algorithms efficiently, so it makes a great entry point for downstream analysis of networks.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">graspologic</span></code> is an open-source Python package developed by Microsoft and the NeuroData lab at Johns Hopkins University which gives you utilities and algorithms for doing analyses on network-valued data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The book favors a hands-on approach, growing an intuitive understanding of
networks through concrete working examples and a bit of theory.
While you can read this book without picking up your laptop, we highly recommend
you experiment with the code examples available online as Jupyter notebooks at <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.neurodata.io/graph-stats-book/index.html">http://docs.neurodata.io/graph-stats-book/index.html</a>.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites<a class="headerlink" href="#prerequisites" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>We assume you have a basic knowledge of mathematics. Because network science uses a lot of linear algebra, requiring a bit of linear algebra knowledge is unavoidable. We expect you have some familiarity with matrices and the basic operations you can do with them: multiplication, addition, and so on.</p>
<p>If you want to best understand the concepts of this book, we think it would be valuable for you to come in with some background in machine learning.</p>
<p>You should also probably have some background in programming - we’ll mainly be using Python to build and explore our networks. If you don’t have too much of a Python or math background, don’t worry - we’ll link some resources to give you a head start.</p>
<p>If you’ve never used Jupyter, don’t worry about it. It is a great tool to have in your toolbox and it’s easy to learn. We’ll also link some resources for you if you are not familiar with Python’s scientific libraries, like numpy, scipy, networkx, and scikit-learn, and a hands-on approach to get you started installing and leveraging these tools.</p>
<p>If you care about what’s under the hood mathematically, we have appendices which isolate the theoretical underpinnings of the techniques developed herein - you should have a reasonable understanding of college-level math, such as calculus, linear algebra, probability, and statistics for these sections.</p>

<section id="roadmap">
<h2>Roadmap<a class="headerlink" href="#roadmap" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>This book is organized into four parts.</p>
<p>Part I, Foundations, gives you a brief overview of the kinds of things you’ll be doing in this book, and shows you how to solve a network machine learning problem from start to finish. It covers the following topics:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What a network is and where you can find networks in the wild</p></li>
<li><p>All the reasons why you should care about studying networks</p></li>
<li><p>Examples of ways you could apply network machine learning to your own projects</p></li>
<li><p>An overview of the types of problems network machine learning is good at dealing with</p></li>
<li><p>The main challenges you’d encounter if you explored Network Learning more deeply</p></li>
<li><p>Exploring a real network machine learning dataset, to get a broad understanding of what you might be able to learn</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Part II, Representations, is all about how we can represent networks statistically, and what we can do with those representations. It covers the following topics:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Ways you can represent individual networks</p></li>
<li><p>Ways you can represent groups of networks</p></li>
<li><p>The various useful properties different types of networks have</p></li>
<li><p>Types of network representations and why they’re useful</p></li>
<li><p>How to represent networks as a bunch of points in space</p></li>
<li><p>How to represent multiple networks</p></li>
<li><p>How to represent networks when you have extra information about your nodes</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Part III, Applications, is about using the representations from Part II to explore and exploit your networks. It covers the following topics:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Figuring out if communities in your networks are different from each other</p></li>
<li><p>Selecting a reasonable model to represent your data</p></li>
<li><p>Finding nodes, edges, or communities in your networks that are interesting</p></li>
<li><p>Finding time points which are anomalies in a network that is evolving over time</p></li>
<li><p>What to do when you have new data after you’ve already trained a network model</p></li>
<li><p>How hypothesis testing works on networks</p></li>
<li><p>Figuring out which nodes are the most similar in a pair of networks</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Part IV, the Appendix, is about providing a more rigorous background in the techniques and approaches described throughout the book. It covers a range of topics found throughout the book, and provides useful academic resources you can explore on your own if you want to delve further into the inner workings of network machine learning.</p>

<section id="other-resources">
<h2>Other resources<a class="headerlink" href="#other-resources" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Many resources exist which will help you greatly with the content of this book.</p>
<p>If you don’t have any background in machine learning quite yet, our favorite starting point is <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=hands+on+machine+learning+with+python&amp;link_code=qs&amp;qid=1652135106&amp;sr=8-1">Hands on machine learning</a>, by Aurélien Géron. We would recommend starting with an introduction to machine learning <em>prior to</em> focusing on this book, because many of the concepts and ideas of this text will make more sense coming in with a machine learning background, however brief. The core ideas you should remember are the types of machine learning problems, some of the more common algorithms and techniques for machine learning (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">K-Means</span></code>, testing, and validation each come up a few times), and the basic data structures used for machine learning.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, there are no other books which explicitly focus on network machine learning for single and multiple network problems just yet. If you want some more exposure to networks in general, we would recommend the following works:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Mohammed Al-Taie and Seifendine Kandry’s <a class="reference external" href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-53004-8">Python for Graph and Network Analysis</a> (Springer) which presents network analysis techniques in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">python</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Ulrik Brandes and Thomas Erlebach’s <a class="reference external" href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/b106453">Network Analysis</a> (Springer) which focuses on the development of the network data structure and summary statistics for networks.</p></li>

<li><p>Eric Kolaczyk’s <a class="reference external" href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-88146-1">Statistical Analysis of Network Data</a> (Springer) which presents some statistical models and methods for network science.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to have a good understanding of the appendices, we would recommend that you start with the book <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Numerical-Linear-Algebra-Lloyd-Trefethen/dp/0898713617">Numerical Linear Algebra</a>, by Lloyd Trefethan and David Bau. You will also want to have some exposure to basic statistics and statistical inference; a good introduction is <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Inference-George-Casella/dp/0534243126/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3PTHF60P7B2GN&amp;keywords=statistical+inference&amp;qid=1652449422&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=statistical+inference%2Cstripbooks%2C64&amp;sr=1-1">Statistical Inference</a> by Casella and Berger, and a good refresher is <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Statistics-Basic-Selected-Topics/dp/0132306379">Mathematical Statistics</a> by Bickel and Doksum. It may also be helpful to be explicitly introduced to statistical learning; our favorite is <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Statistical-Learning-Applications-Statistics/dp/1461471370">Introduction to Statistical Learning</a>, by Gareth Jones, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Rob Tibshirani.</p>

<h3>Code examples<a class="headerlink" href="#code-examples" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>The entirety of this book has been compiled using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">jupyter</span></code> notebooks, integrated through the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">jupyter-book</span></code> framework. The book is currently hosted on github at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/neurodata/graph-stats-book">github.com/neurodata/graph-stats-book</a>, and the build log for the text can be found at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/neurodata/graph-stats-book/actions">github.com/neurodata/graph-stats-book/actions</a>. You can find every section notebook, and every command which was used to prepare the environment in which the corresponding textbook pages were executed, using those two links.</p>
<p>All of the code used to prepare simulations, algorithms, or figures are contained within this book. This means that to recreate a figure for a particular section, you just need to run the corresponding code provided. In general, all code relevant to an algorithm or simulation are shown explicitly. Code only relevant to plotting, however, may be hidden if you have already seen code which produces a similar or identical plot previously. For example, a python code block, and its corresponding output, looks like this:</p>

<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ echo &quot;this is a bash command&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$</span></code> indicates the start of the line, and is not part of what you actually type. If we want to tell you what you should anticipate output wise for a bash command, it will look like this:</p>
