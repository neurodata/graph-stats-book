    "In this section, we'll try to motivate network machine learning with some behind the scenes work, to give you a feel for what the process is really like, from start to finish. While some of the material in this section might seem a little bit opaque at first, we'll try to keep the details lighter, and the big picture in focus. This section largely will just give you a chance to play around with network machine learning in a real setting, before we start jumping right into the nitty, gritty details. Further, this will give you a chance to ensure that you have all of the dependencies set up appropriately before you begin your foray into network machine learning. Things run a lot smoother, in our experience, when you have a working programming environment before you jump into attempting to learn. We have the following sections:\n",
