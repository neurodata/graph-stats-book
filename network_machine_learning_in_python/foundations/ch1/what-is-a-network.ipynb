    "When most people think of a \"network\", they often have some vague image in their head of the internet, or of cell phone towers transmitting data, or of some other technical thing. But networks have a specific definition in the world of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the most simple terms, a network is a set of objects in which pairs of objects have a simple, clearly defined relationship to each other, and can be thought of as connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other places, you might hear networks referred to as \"graphs\", and the field studying them as \"graph theory\". We don't really like that word, since it's too easy to confuse a graph and a plot with an x/y coordinate axis. We'll stick to the term \"network\" throughout this book when possible. There might be times when we have to use the word \"graph\", since the name of some algorithm or tool we're showing you uses it, but just remember that they mean the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get a little bit more specific about what we mean. Each object in your network is called a node, or a vertex (we'll stick to node in this book, just for consistency's sake). A connection between two nodes is called an edge. Below you can see a visualization of a simple network with 8 nodes. As you can see, some nodes are well-connected with other nodes -- for example, the node in the center, with edges to five other nodes -- and you can also have nodes which aren't connected to anything, like the lonely extra node without any edges."

    "Another major focus of this book will be viewing networks statistically: chapter 5 explores this idea in depth. When you view a network from a statistic or probabilistic perspective, you're viewing it fundamentally as an *observation* of a random variable (or in this case, a random network): a noisy real-thing thing that is the output of a probabilistic model. Your probabilistic model might contain communities, for instance: the first ten nodes might have a higher probability of connection than the second ten. When you observe concrete networks from this model, the details of which node is connected to which might change, but you can find general trends. This idea is at the core of modern statistics, so being able to apply it to networks will be an important change in perspective."

You'll get a high-level, big-picture overview, and we won't get into the weeds too much here. Unlike the rest of the book, there won't be very much code in this chapter.
