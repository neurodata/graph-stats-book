    "Say you're a criminal investigator trying to uncover a human trafficking ring. You build a network of potential suspects: some of the nodes in the network represent human traffickers, and some represent innocent people. The edges of the network represent a working relationship between a given pair of individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your team has limited resources, and so it's difficult to scrutinize everybody in the network directly to see if they are human traffickers. Ideally, you'd like to use your network to nominate potential suspects, so that you can prioritize your investigative efforts. You've already done some work: you have a list of a few nodes of the network who are known to be traffickers, and you have a list of a few who you know are not. Your goal, then, is to build an ordered list of nodes in the network that are most similar to the nodes you already know belong to human traffickers. Ideally, the first nodes in the list would be more likely to be traffickers, and the nodes would get less and less likely the further down in the list you go.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the idea behind *single-network vertex nomination*. You have a group of \"seed nodes\" that you know have the right community membership, and then you take the rest of the nodes in your network and order them by their relationship to the seed nodes in terms of that community membership. The nomination task here isn't just classification: it's prioritization. You're prioritizing how important the rest of your nodes are with respect to the seed nodes, with the most important nodes at the top."

    "There are a few approaches to vertex nomination. You can take a likelihood-maximization approach, or a bayes-optimal approach - but what we'll focus on is *Spectral Vertex Nomination*. The general idea is that you embed your network, and then you just order the latent positions by how close they are to the seed node latent positions. There are a few ways of doing this: you could create a *separate* set of nominees for each node, for instance. This would correspond to finding the people closest to *each* human trafficker, rather than finding a single list of nominees. You could also just get a single list of nominees: you could first take the centroid of the latent positions of your seed nodes, and then find the closest nodes to that *centroid*. There are also a few different ways of defining what it means to be \"close\" to seed node latent positions. The obvious way is euclidean distance, which is what you'd traditionally think of as the distance between two points, but you could also use something like the Mahalanobis distance, which is essentially Euclidean distance but with a coordinate system and a rescaling defined by the covariance in your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, all forms of Spectral Vertex Nomination involve finding embeddings and then taking distances. In contrast to the other approaches, it scales well with very large networks (since you're essentially just doing an embedding followed by a simple calculation) and doesn't require any prior knowledge of community membership.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see what spectral vertex nomination looks like. Below, we see the latent positions for a network with three communities, where two of the communities are more closely linked than the third community. We do a standard adjacency spectral embedding, and we end up with a set of latent positions. Our seed nodes - the ones whose community membership we know - are marked."
