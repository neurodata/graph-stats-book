    "# Testing for Significant Edges\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next two sections, we will turn back to an example we came across back when we discussed the [Signal Subnetwork model](ch5:multicovar:ssn). If you recall, we had $200$ networks, which were either earthlings or aliens. The networks each had $5$ nodes, which represented different sensory modalities: an area responsible for sight, language, hearing/emotional expression, thinking/movement, and basic survival functions (heartbeat and breathing). Edges existed if two areas of the brain could pass information to one another. \n",
    "\n",
    "The aliens are humans who were forced to live for several hundred thousand years on a planet in which their eyesight was challenged, and over time, evolution selected the aliens who had a higher probability of connections between the sight area and other areas of the brain. Our question of interest was as follows: if we are shown a network, how do we decide whether that network is from an earthling or an alien? Can we come up with a way to parse out the signal from the non-signal; that is, identify the [subnetworks](ch4:prop-net:subnetwork) that have been altered?\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin to address this question, we came up with the signal subnetwork model. What we established with the signal subnetwork model was that all of the edges in each network could be broken up into one of two groups: either the signal edges or the non-signal edges. We collected these signal edges into a set called the \"signal subnetwork\", which was a parameter for the signal subnetwork model. For these signal edges, the probability of an edge existing (or not) was different for two (or more) classes in our problem. What this means is that, in our problem above, the edges which had a node which was responsible for sight had a different connection probability for the aliens than the earthlings. On the other hand, the non-signal edges did not have a different connection probability for the aliens than the earthlings. \n",
    "\n",
    "To start this section off, let's first sample some example networks from the signal subnetwork model. Let's assume that we have a total of $200$ people, each of whom are either aliens (with probability $\\pi_{alien} = 0.45$) or earthlings (with probability $\\pi_{earth} = 0.55$). First, we'll roll our 2-sided die $200$ times, where side 1 (class 1) corresponds to aliens, and side 2 (class 2) corresponds to earthlings. We will then create the class assignment vector $\\vec y$ using the number of times the die lands on each class:"

    "The key ideas we want to capture in our classifier are as follows:\n",
    "1. We want to *only* look at the edges which have a differing connection probability amongst our classes. This means that we only want to look at *signal edges* which are in the *signal subnetwork*, and we want to ignore edges which are not in the signal subnetwork. Edges which are not in the signal subnetwork are simply noise, since they have the same connection probability between the classes, and therefore are not useful for differentiating between the different classes.\n",
    "2. We want to incorporate the structure of the network into the classifier. This means we want to use the fact that nodes are nodes, and that edges are connections between nodes, to determine how to classify networks as earthling or alien.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we will start by addressing aim 1. We need to find which edges are in the signal subnetwork. Stated another way, we need to *estimate* the signal subnetwork. What this requires is a way to identify which edges will best capture the difference between the classes in our network. Do we know anything which can do this? As it turns out, we can use Fisher's exact test, something we learned about in the section on [testing for differences between groups of edges](http://docs.neurodata.io/graph-stats-book/applications/ch8/testing-differences.html#two-sample-hypothesis-testing-with-coins), to identify the signal subnetwork. In the next section on [identifying significant vertices](#link?), we will address the second point on using the structure of the network to further refine these potential signal edges.\n",

    "## Fisher's Exact Test for Edge Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "If you remember back to the coin flip example for the [two-sample test with edge clusterings](ch7:testing:twosample), our setup was as follows. We had two coins, coin $1$ and coin $2$, and we wanted to test whether their probabilities of landing on heads were different. Our hypotheses were $H_A: p_1 \\neq p_2$, against the null hypothesis that $H_0: p_1 = p_2$. We therefore had two random samples, the outcomes of ten coin flips from coin one and the outcomes of ten coin flips from coin two, meaning that our test of $H_A$ against $H_0$ fell into the *two-sample testing* regime. To address this, what we used was Fisher's exact test, where we counted the number of times each coin landed on heads and tails, which we aggregated in a table:\n",
    "\n",
    "| | First coin | Second coin |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| Landed on heads | 7 | 3 |\n",
    "| Landed on tails | 3 | 7 |\n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out, we can adapt this test for our situation here too! For a single edge, what we want to do is test whether $H_A: p_{ij}^{(alien)} \\neq p_{ij}^{(earth)}$, against the null hypothesis that $H_0: p_{ij}^{(alien)} = p_{ij}^{(earth)}$. The key property of Fisher's exact test that makes it desirable for us is that, in a sense, when there is more evidence to support $H_A$, the $p$-value will tend to be smaller, whereas when there is more evidence to support $H_0$, the $p$-value will tend to be larger. We will exploit this feature in our design of a classifier for aliens versus earthlings. For each edge $(i, j)$, we will construct the following table:\n",
    "\n",
    "| | aliens | Earthlings |\n",

    "\n",
    "We will use the Fisher's exact $p$-value to develop an approach which allows us to properly estimate a signal subnetwork model. The key idea is this: if we were to use any one edge of the network, we would not really be able to predict whether someone is an earthling or an alien. The reason for this is that edges either exist, or not, so unless one of the class edge probabilities for a particular edge happens to be really low (near zero) and the other happens to be really high (near one), the only informative decision boundary we could construct would be to assign one class to the networks where that particular edge exists, or the other class to the networks where that particular edge does not exist. Even less interestingly, we could abitrarily say that every network is in a particular class, which is also not going to be a particularly interesting classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing we could do would be to use *every* edge in the network to develop a classifier, which also isn't the best we could do. This is because if we use every edge in the classifier, we would have a lot of *noise* from the non-signal edges. This means that even though we might learn *something* from the signal edges, anything we learn is going to end up being diluted down by noise because we are including a lot of uninformative information in our classifier (the non-signal edges).\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather, what we want to do is investigate to find the edges which are carrying all of the signal, and then isolate our downstream learning from information captured by those edges. This is because the signal edges carry all of the informative information about differentiating networks from one class to the other. This begs the question, how do we find the signal edges, and isolate them from the non-signal edges?\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned in the preceding subsection, as it happens, the Fisher's exact test statistic is going to tend to be larger for edges in which there is actual signal (the edge probability is different for aliens and earthlings), and smaller when there is no signal (the edge probability is the same for aliens and earthlings). That is, if an edge is in the signal subnetwork, the Fisher's exact test $p$-value is small, and if it is not in the signal subnetwork, the Fisher's exact $p$-value is big. For this reason, what we end up doing is *rank transforming* the Fisher's exact test $p$-values, and then pick an arbitrary number of the lowest ranking $p$-values to retain for classification. \n",

    "A question you might be wondering concerns how exactly we chose the number of signal edges to include in our estimate of the signal subnetwork, $\\hat{\\mathcal S}$. If we knew the number of edges in the signal subnetwork ahead of time, the choice would be easy: just choose $K$ to be the number of edges in the signal subnetwork! In real data, however, this isn't really going to be the case. For this reason, we will have to estimate $K$ using $\\hat K$. To learn how to estimate $K$, we first need to learn how to put what we've covered so far into a classifier, so read on!\n",

    "## Building a classifier using the estimated signal subnetwork\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can use the estimated signal subnetwork that we have constructed to devise a classifier. The objective of a classifier is to take new pieces of data (in this case, new networks), and assign them to the class which they are most likely from. How do we determine which class a network is most likely from?\n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment, we have our estimate of the signal subnetwork, $\\hat{\\mathcal S}$, and have a bunch of networks from one of two classes: alien (class 1) or alien (class 2). The edges of the network are binary, and we want to use the edges which are in the signal subnetwork to classify points as either alien or alien. A natural classifier choice for this situation is known as the Naive Bayes classifier. We have all the ingredients we need to construct a Naive Bayes classifier, so we'll try to piece this together. For details on the intuition and background of this algorithm, check out the appendix section on the [Naive Bayes classifier](app:ch14:nb).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network classification\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do we actually use the estimated signal subnetwork $\\hat{\\mathcal S}$ to classify new networks? Quite simply, we can just use sklearn's `BernoulliNB` from `sklearn`, which is the Naive Bayes classifier for data where the features take values of $0$ and $1$ (such as our network). We need to reorganize our data a little bit to get it into the format we want. Our estimated signal subnetwork $\\hat{\\mathcal S}$ is returned to us by `graspologic` in the format of a `[2 x K]` matrix, where $K$ is the number of edges in the signal subnetwork. The first row is the row index of the entry of the signal subnetwork, and the second row is the column index of the entry in the signal subnetwork. We need to coerce this into an `[M x K]` matrix which we will call $D$, where $M$ is the total number of networks, and $K$ is the number of edges in the signal subnetwork. Each entry of this matrix $d_{mk}$ represents the adjacency value of the $m^{th}$ individual for the $k^{th}$ element of the signal subnetwork:"
