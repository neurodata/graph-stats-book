    "There is a particular type of sea slug which has gills on the outside of its body. When you squirt water at these gills, they withdraw into the slug. The interesting thing about this type of slug is that the brain network involved in this gill withdrawal reflex is entirely mapped out, from the neurons which detect and transmit information about the water into the slug's brain, to the neurons that leave the brain and fire at its muscles. (For those interested, this is a real thing - look up Eric Kandel's research on Aplysia!)\n",

    "Say you're a researcher studying these sea slugs, and you have a bunch of brain networks of the same slug. We can define each node as a single neuron, and edges denote connections between neurons. Each of the brain networks that you have were taken at different time points: some before water started getting squirted at the slug's gills, and some as the water was getting squirted. Your goal is to reconstruct when water started to get squirted, using only the networks themselves. You hypothesize that there should be some signal change in your networks which can tell you the particular time at which water started getting squirted. Given the network data you have, how do you figure out which timepoints these are?\n",

    "The broader class of problems this question addresses is called *anomaly detection*. The idea, in general, is that you have a bunch of snapshots of the same network over time. Although the nodes are the same, the edges are changing at each time point. Your goal is to figure out which time points correspond to the most change, either in the entire network or in particular groups of nodes. You can think of a network as \"anomalous\" with respect to time if some potentially small group of nodes within the network concurrently changes behavior at some point in time compared to the recent past, while the remaining nodes continue with whatever noisy, normal behavior they had.\n",

All of the nodes in the network are likely changing a bit over time, since there is some variability intrinsic in the system. Random noise might just dictate that some edges get randomly deleted and some get randomly created at each step. We want to figure out if there are timepoints where the change isn't just random noise: we're trying to figure out a point in time where the probability distribution that the network *itself* is generated from changes.\n",

    "It's time to start thinking about how we'd approach figuring out which of the time points are anomalies. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simplest approaches to this problem might just be to figure out which node has the highest count of edge changes across your timeseries. For each node across the timeseries, you'd count the number of new edges that appeared (compared to the previous point in time), and the number of existing edges that were deleted. Whichever count is highest could be your anomalous node.\n",
    "\n",
    "This might give you a rough estimate -- and you could even potentially find perturbed time points with this approach -- but it's not necessarily the best solution. Counting edges doesn't account for other important pieces of information: for instance, you might be interested in which other nodes new edges were formed with. It seems like deleting or creating edges with more important nodes, for instance, should be weighted higher than deleting or creating edges with unimportant nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's try another method. You might actually be able to guess it! The idea will be to simply estimate each network's latent positions, followed by a hypothesis testing approach. Here's the idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's call the latent positions for our network $X^{(t)}$ for the snapshot of the network at time $t$. You're trying to find specific time points, $X^{(i)}$, which are different from their previous time point $X^{(i-1)}$. Here, we're going to define \"different\" as the *spectral norm of the difference*, which is the largest singular value of $X^{(t)}$ and $X^{(t - 1)}$. This is denoted by the quantity $||X^{(t)} - X^{(t - 1)}||_2$, which is the $2$-norm of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "This quantity will be relatively big if $X^{(t)}$ and $X^{(t-1)}$ are not very similar, and relatively small if $X^{(t)}$ and $X^{(t-1)}$ are more similar, because it is summing the squared differences between all of the entries of $X^{(t)}$ and $X^{(t - 1)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, We're trying to find the time points where the difference in norm between the latent positions at time $t$ and the latent positions at time $t-1$ is *relatively* large. The idea is that non-anomalous time points (where the latent position matrices are the same) will have a difference of zero, but anomalous time points (where the latent position matrices are not the same) will have a difference which exceeds zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "There's an alternate problem where you restrict your view to *subsets of nodes* rather than entire adjacency matrices. The idea is that you'd find time-points which are anomalous for particular nodes or groups of nodes, rather than the entire network. The general idea is the same: you find latent positions, then test for how big the difference is between time point $t$ and time point $t-1$. This time, however, your test is for particular nodes. We'll be focusing on the problem for whole networks, but you can take a look at the original paper if you're curious about how to apply it to nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges of anomaly detection\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, however, this is a bit more challenging than just looking for the consecutive time points with differences that exceed zero. Even in a perfect environment, such as under simulation, we run across two variations of problems that we have seen before. To perform timeseries anomaly detection, what you are first going to assume is that each network $A^{(t)}$ you observe is a sample of an [RDPG](ch5:rdpg) with a latent position matrix $X^{(t)}$, for all timepoints $t$ from $1$ to $T$. Further, we assume that the latent dimensionality $d$ is known to be the same across all of the networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each timepoint, we have the following question of interest: are the latent positions equal; that is, $H_0^{(t)} : X^{(t)} = X^{(t - 1)}W$, for some rotation matrix $W$? Or are the latent positions different; that is, $H_A^{(t)} : X^{(t)} \\neq X^{(t - 1)}W$?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The nonidentifiability problem\n",
    "\n",
    "When you observe the network $A^{(t)}$, you only observe the network itself: not the underlying latent position matrix $X^{(t)}$. Instead, you estimate the latent position matrix, $\\hat X^{(t)}$, using [spectral embeddings](ch6:spectral). Unfortunately, latent position matrices are rotationally non-identifiable: that is, you cannot identify one latent position matrix $X^{(t)}$ from another latent position matrix $Y^{(t)} = X^{(t)}W$ where $W$ is a rotation, and the same goes for estimates of these quantities $\\hat Y{(t)}$ and $\\hat X^{(t)}$ as well. This means that you will need a strategy which \"rotates\" all of the latent position estimates into the same space. To overcome this hurdle, we need an approach which takes networks, and produces latent position estimates for each network which are rotationally aligned. Fortunately, you already know how to do this: you can use the [OMNI embedding](ch6:multinet:omni). Once your estimates are all aligned in the same latent space, you can ignore the rotation matrix, $W$, for all practical purposes for the remainder of this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### We only get to obtain estimates of latent positions\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have latent position estimates for each network $\\hat X^{(t)}$ that are all rotated into the same space, you are presented with a new problem: the latent position estimates still won't equal the true, underlying latent positions $X^{(t)}$. This means that even if $X^{(t)} = X^{(t - 1)}$, and you are able to orient $\\hat X^{(t)}$ and $X^{(t - 1)}$ so that they are rotationally aligned, your estimates *still* won't be equal. Remember these quantities are only *estimates* of latent positions, which means they will be subject to random noise *even if* the underlying true latent positions are exactly equal. That means that we aren't going to be able to just check whether two time points have a *Frobenius difference* that differs from zero; rather, we're going to need to figure out what *relatively large* and *relatively small* amount to in the context of our sample.

    "An important point to clarify is that there are a lot of different types of matrix norms: Frobenius norm, spectral norm, and so on. In our case, we'll be using the $l_2$ operator norm, which is simply the largest singular value of the matrix. The `ord` parameter argument in numpy determines which norm we use, and `ord=2` is the operator norm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this norm, intuitively, will tell us how different two matrices are. If the norm of the difference between the true latent positions $X - Y$ is small, then $X$ and $Y$ are very similar matrices; whereas if the norm of $X - Y$ is large, then $X$ and $Y$ are very different. The norm should be large for anomalies, and small for everything else."
