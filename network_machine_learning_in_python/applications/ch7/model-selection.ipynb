    "In the past two sections, we've covered quite a bit of ground in our understanding of Stochastic Block Models. We introduced the Structured Independent Edge Model, a generalization of the Stochastic Block Model that allows us to compare probabilities of various edge clusters in the network. Next, we introduced the community detection problem, and showed how the adjacency spectal embedding coupled with various adjustments of unsupervised clustering techniques allowed us to learn estimated community assignments $\\vec z$ fo the nodes of the network. We then learned how we can use these community assignments to produce estimates of the block matrix, $\\hat B$, so that we have a useful model of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have learned over the course of the book so far, one of our core aims in machine learning is to identify the *simplest* model that maintains a *veridical* representation of the underlying data with which we are presented. Stated another way, we want a model which is parsimonious: it has enough parameters to explain the data, but not so many that we are overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we toss two identical fair coins $20$ times and $10$ times respectively, which each have $p_1 = p_2 = p = 0.5$ (the probability of landing on heads, $0.5$, is identical to the probability of landing on tails). The first coin lands on heads $11$ times out of $20$ flips, and the second coin lands on heads $4$ times. In truth, these coins are identical; we simply, by chance, produced estimates $\\hat p_1 = \\frac{11}{20} = 0.55$ and $\\hat p_2 = \\frac{4}{10} = 0.4$. In reality, the best estimate of $\\hat p$, the true probability, would be to *pool* across the two samples, which would give us that $\\hat p = \\frac{15}{30} = 0.5$. The problem here is, when we have a real sample of data, we *don't know* that $p_1 = p_2$. As we learned in the preceding section, we can derive hypotheses tests where $H_0: p_1 = p_2$ against $H_a: p_1 = p_2$, and we can simply test these hypotheses directly. Let's say we didn't flip two coins, however. Let's say we flipped three coins, where in reality $p_1 = p_2 = 0.5$, and $p_3 = 0.4$. We need to build upon our two-sample hypothesis testing strategies in order to produce ideal inference about the relationships between $p_1$, $p_2$, and $p_3$. To answer these sorts of questions, we turn to *model selection*. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Model selection** is the task of selecting among several possible statistical models which we think may describe our sample. We do this using quantitative strategies to determine which statistical models are best supported by the data. In our coin flip example with three coins where $p_1$ and $p_2$ are equal but $p_3$ is diffferent, this means that we use the sample to determine reasonable statistical models that could be possible. In the context of coin flipping experiments, the statistical models are delineated by the types of coins that could have reasonably been used for the experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, we might propose a statistical model where $p_1 = p_2 = p_3$, another model where $p_1 = p_2$ but $p_3$ does not equal $p_1$ nor $p_2$, and a third model where $p_1$, $p_2$, and $p_3$ were all different. As an observer, you might say, this subset of three possible statistical model misses quite a few possibilities! There is another possible model where $p_2 = p_3$ but $p_1$ does not equal $p_2$ nor $p_3$, and another where $p_1 = p_3$ but $p_2$ does not equal $p_1$ nor $p_3$. Each of these models has a corresponding hypothesis under which the model is \"correct\". When we actually want to select the bests model, however, we will use the fact a specific property of the hypotheses we actually chose, the fact that they are *sequentially nested*, to identify the best statistical model supported by the sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Sequentially nested hypotheses allow us to choose the best hypothesis from the candidates\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's formalize this situation a little bit more. We have the following three hypotheses. $H_0: p_1 = p_2 = p_3 = a$, against $H_1: p_1 = p_2 = a$, but $p_3 = c$. Finally, we have $H_2: p_1 = a$, $p_2 = b$, and $p_3 = c$. The hypothesis $H$ is **nested** in the hypothesis $H'$ if whenever $H$ is true, $H'$ is also true. In this sense, the hypothesis $H'$ is said to contain the hypothesis $H$. Let's consider $H_0$ and $H_1$, for instance. Notice that if $H_0$ is true, then $p_1 = p_2 = p_3 = a$. However, $H_1$ is also true, since $p_1 = p_2 = a$, and $p_3= c$ can also be set equal to $p_1$ and $p_2$ if $c = a$. \n",
    "\n",
    "A sequence of hypotheses $H_0, H_1, ..., H_n$ is called **sequentially nested** if $H_0$ is nested in $H_1$, which is nested in $H_2$, so on and so forth up to $H_{n-1}$ is nested in $H_n$. Note that the sequence of hypotheses that we presented for our three coin example are sequentially nested. We already saw that $H_0$ was nested in $H_1$. Now, let's compare $H_2$ to $H_1$. Notet that if $a = b$, that $p_1 = p_2$, and $p_3 = c$, exactly as in $H_1$, so $H_1$ is nested in $H_2$. Therefore, since $H_0$ is nested in $H_1$ and $H_1$ is nested in $H_2$, The sequence $H_0$, $H_1$, and $H_2$ are sequentially nested. \n",
    "\n",
    "What advantage does sequentially nesting hypotheses give us? In statistics, and in particular when dealing with sequences of hypothesis tests all of which correspond to candidate models which are based on the Bernoulli distribution, statistical tests can be used to *provably* identify the best candidate model corresponding to a hypothesis. This means that we can select one of the $n$ total hypotheses amongst $H_0, ..., H_n$, and can use the results of this hypothesis to construct a statistical model which is best supported by the data. This distinction is key for numerous statistical results, and will form the foundation of our development of model selection approaches for network machine learning.  \n",

    "What does this have to do with network data? Let's imagine that we are presented with the school network that we are accustomed to. $100$ students attend one of two schools. Nodes are students, and edges represent whether a pair of students are friends. We'll imagine we've already performed community detection on the network, and have sorted the nodes based on the school to which the students attend: "

    "1. The network is Erdos-Renyi: the simplest possible model would be the model where all of the block probabilities are the same; that is, $b_{11} = b_{12} = b_{21} = b_{22}$. This is equivalent to an Erdos-Renyi random network with probability $a$, $ER_n(a)$. This doesn't seem totally reasonable based on the estimated block probability matrix we see above, but it is better to ask questions to see whether something else is better supported by the data than it is to make outright assumptions. For this reason, we will let the null hypothesis $H_0 : b_{11} = b_{12} = b_{21} = b_{22} = a$. This can be encoded in graspologic using the string, `\"aaaa\"`, or that all four entries of the four-block matrix $B$ are the same value, $a$. It is typically the case when testing statistical models to let the null hypothesis $H_0$ be that the network is Erdos-Renyi.\n",

The within-community edges share a common probability $a$, and the between-community edges share a common probability $b$ which is distinct from $a$. The corresponding hypothesis is indicated by $H_1 : b_{11} = b_{22} = a, b_{12} = b_{21} = b, a \\neq b$. This hypothesis can be encoded in graspologic using the string, `\"abba\"`.\n",

However, we notice something particularly strange: For a portion of the tests, we are, in-fact, *wrong*. We obtain many $p$-values which are under our decision threshold of $\\alpha = 0.05$, and would incorrectly report that the alternative hypothesis is correct, and $p_i$ is *not* $0.5$. This is wrong, and extremely problematic! Remember that the $p$-value was defined as the probability that the null hypothesis (here, that $p_i = 0.5$) would be incorrectly rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis (here, that $p_i \\neq 0.5$). In fact, if the null hypothesis were true, we would expect to see $p$-values of at most $\\alpha$ being reported about $\\alpha$ of the time (this assumes all of the coins are independent, but even when they are not all independent, we still obtain a similarly shocking conclusion).

The **familywise error rate** (FWER) is the probability that we made an error and incorrectly rejected the null hypothesis for *any one* of the hypothesis tests we ran.

These strategies are collectively known as **multiple comparisons adjustments**. We won't go into too many details with how multiple comparisons adjustments are performed, but in general given a list of $p$-values `pvals`, you can adjust the $p$-values using the `multipletests()` method from `statsmodels`.
