    "Let's imagine that we have $100$ students, each of whom can go to one of two possible schools: school one or school two. Our network has $100$ nodes, and each node represents a single student. The edges of this network represent whether a pair of students are friends. Intuitively, if two students go to the same school, the probably have a higher chance of being friends than if they do not go to the same school. If we were to try to characterize this using an ER random network, we would run into a problem: we have no way to capture the impact that school has on friendships. Intuitively, there must be a better way!"

    "The Stochastic Block Model, or SBM, captures this idea by assigning each of the $n$ nodes in the network to one of $K$ communities. A **community** is a group of nodes within the network. In our example case, the communities would represent the schools that students are able to attend. We use $K$ here to just denote an integer greater than $1$ (for example, in the school example we gave above, $K$ is $2$) for the number of *possible* communities that nodes could be members of. In an SBM, instead of describing all pairs of nodes with a fixed probability like with the ER model, we instead describe properties that hold for edges between *pairs of communities*. In our example, what this means is that if two students go to school one, the probability that they are friends might be different than if the two students went to school two, or if one student went to school one and the other to school two. Let's take a look at what a realization of this setup we have described might look like:"

    "To describe an SBM random network, we proceed very similarly to an ER random network, with a twist. An SBM random network has a parameter, $\\vec\\tau$, which has a single element for each of the node. We call $\\vec\\tau$ the **community assignment vector**, which means that for each node of our random network, $\\tau_i$ tells us which community the node is in. To state this another way, $\\vec\\tau$ is a vector where each element $\\tau_i$ can take one of $K$ possible values, where $K$ is the total number of communities in the network. For example, if we had an SBM random network with four nodes in total, and two total communities, each element $\\tau_i$ can be either $1$ or $2$. If the first two nodes were in community $1$, and the second two in community $2$, we would say that $\\tau_1 = 1$, $\\tau_2 = 1$, $\\tau_3 = 2$, and $\\tau_4 = 2$, which means that $\\vec\\tau$ looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\vec\\tau^\\top &= \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 & 2 & 2\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The other parameter for an SBM random network is called the block matrix, for which we will use the capital letter $B$. If there are $K$ communities in the SBM random network, then $B$ is a $K \\times K$ matrix, with one entry for each pair of communities. For instance, if $K$ were two like above, $B$ would be a $2 \\times 2$ matrix, and would look like this:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    B &= \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "        b_{11} & b_{12} \\\\ b_{21} & b_{22}\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Each of the entries of $B$, which we denote as $b_{kl}$ in the above matrix, is a probability of an edge existing between a node in community $k$ and a node in community $l$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we can also think of this formulation of a random network using coin flips. In our mini example above, if node $1$ is in community $1$ (since $\\tau_1 = 1$) and node $2$ is in community $1$ (since $\\tau_2 = 1$), we have a weighted coin which has a probability $b_{11}$ (the first row, first column of the block matrix above) of landing on heads, and a $1 - b_{11}$ chance of landing on tails. An edge between nodes one and two exists if the weighted coin lands on heads, and does not exist if that weighted coin lands on tails. If we wanted to describe an edge between nodes one and three instead, note that $\\tau_3 = 2$. Therefore, we use the entry $b_{12}$ as the probability of obtaining a heads for the weighted coin we flip this time. In the general case, to use the block matrix to obtain the probability of an edge $(i, j)$ existing between any pair of nodes $i$ and $j$ in our network, we will flip a coin with probability $b_{\\tau_i \\tau_j}$, where $\\tau_i$ is the community assignment for the $i^{th}$ node and $\\tau_j$ is the community assignment for the $j^{th}$ node.\n",

    "\n",
    "The procedure below will produce for us a network $A$, which has nodes and edges, where the underlying random network $\\mathbf A$ is an $SBM_n(\\vec\\tau, B)$ random network:\n",

Say we have $100$ students, and we know that each student goes to one of two possible schools. Remember that we already know the community assignment vector $\\vec{\\tau}$ ahead of time. We don't really care too much about the ordering of the students for now, so let's just assume that the first $50$ students all go to the first school, and the second $50$ students all go to the second school. \n",
