    "The IER random network is the most general random network model for a binary graph. The way you can think of the IER random network is that a probability matrix $P$ with $n$ rows and $n$ columns defines each of the edge-existence probabilities for pairs of nodes in the network. For each pair of nodes $i$ and $j$, you have a unique coin which has a $p_{ij}$ chance of landing on heads, and a $1 - p_{ij}$ chance of landing on tails. If the coin lands on heads, the edge between nodes $i$ and $j$ exists, and if the coin lands on tails, the edge between nodes $i$ and $j$ does not exist. This coin flip is performed independently of the coin flips for all of the other edges. If $\\mathbf A$ is a random network which is $IER$ with a probability matrix $P$, we say that $\\mathbf A$ is an $IER_n(P)$ random network.\n",

The previous single network models you have covered to date simply place restrictions on the way in which you acquire $P$. For instance, in an $ER_n(p)$ random network, all entries $p_{ij}$ of $P$ can just be set equal to $p$. To see that an $SBM_n(\\vec z, B)$ random network is also $IER_n(P)$, you can construct the probability matrix $P$ such that $p_{ij} = b_{kl}$ of the block matrix $B$ when the community of node $i$ is $z_i = k$ and the community of node $j$ is $z_j = l$. To see that an $RDPG_n(X)$ random network is also $IER_n(P)$, you can construct the probability matrix $P$ such that $P = XX^\\top$. This shows that the IER random network is the most general of the single network models you have studied so far. \n",

What this means is that all models discussed so far, and many not discussed but found in the appendix, can be conceptualized as special cases of the IER network. Stated in other words, a probability matrix is the fundamental unit necessary to describe an independent-edge random network model. For the models covered so far, all GRDPGs are IER networks (by taking $P$ to be $XY^\\top$), all RDPGs are GRDPGs (by taking the right latent positions $Y$ to be equal to the left latent positions $X$), all SBMs are RDPGs, and all ERs are SBMs, whereas the converses in general are not true. \n",

    "This construction is not entirely useful when you have one sample, because for each edge, you only get to see one sample (either the edge exists or doesn't exist). This means that you won't really be able to learn about the individual edge probabilities in practice when you only have a single sample of a network in a way which would differentiate them from other single networks. What we mean by this is, if you learn about other single networks, you are still *technically* learning about an IER random network, because like you saw in the last paragraph, all of these other single network models are just *special cases* of the IER random network. However, you can't learn any random network with one sample that could *only* be described by an IER random network, so it almost feels a *little bit useless* from what you've covered so far. As you will learn shortly, the IER random network is, on the other hand, *extremely* useful when you have multiple networks. When you have multiple networks, with some limited assumptions, you *can* learn about networks that you would otherwise not be able to describe with more simple random networks like ER, SBM, or RDPG random netweorks. This will make the IER random network *extremely powerful* when you have multiple samples of network data."
