    "As we can see, $P$ captures a similar modular structure to the actual adjacency matrix corresponding to the SBM network. When we say this network is *modular*, we mean that it looks block-y, in that there are clusters of edges sharing a similar probability. Also, $P$ captures the probability of connections between each pair of students. It is the case that $P$ contains the information of both $\\vec z$ and $B$. This means that we can write down a generative model by specifying *only* $P$, and we no longer need to specify $\\vec z$ nor $B$ at all.\n",

On the other hand, in this formulation, $P$ has $\\binom{n}{2}$ entries, which is much bigger than $n + K \\times K$ (since $K$ is usually much smaller than $n$). One thing you might be wondering, however, is can we make things even *more* general by using $P$ instead of $\\vec z$ and $B$? As we can see in our probability matrix above, there are only $4$ unique entries in total!

This matrix $X$ is a special matrix called the latent position matrix, which we will discuss further in this section and in the [section on estimation](link?). We will call a single row of $X$ the vector $\\vec x_i$. Using this expression, each entry $p_{ij}$ is going to end up being the product $\\vec x_i^\\top \\vec x_j$, for all $i, j$. Like $P$, $X$ has $n$ rows, each of which corresponds to a single node in our network. However, the special property of $X$ is that it doesn't *necessarily* have $n$ columns: rather, $X$ often will have many fewer columns than rows. For instance, with $P$ from the example above on Stochastic Block Models, there in fact exists an $X$ with just $2$ columns that can be used to describe $P$. Let's take a look at what $X$ looks like. We won't discuss how to compute this $X$ just yet, but we'll try to build some insight into what's going on here:"

Therefore, the latent position of the node $i$, $\\vec x_i$, is a $d$-dimensional vector.

The latent dimensionality of the latent position matrix for the SBM example, it turns out, is $2$, because we have two total latent dimensions for our latent position matrix $X$. We will take the latent dimensions, and make the first latent dimension the $x$-axis, and the second latent dimension the $y$-axis. We next plot, for each node $i$, a single point, whose $x$-coordinate will be the first latent dimension for the latent position of node $i$, and the $y$-coordinate will be the second latent dimension for the latent position of node $i$.

    "Why does our scatter plot look like it only has $2$ points on it? Quite simply, for an SBM, *every* node within the same community has an *identical* latent position! This means that all of the nodes representing students who are in school $1$ have the same latent positition vector as the other students in school $1$. Similarly, all of the nodes representing students who are in school $2$ have the same latent position vector as the other students in school $2$. Even though it looks like there is only $1$ point for each school community, there are really $50$ total latent position vectors for each student within that community and they just happen to overlap. This does not need to be the case for the latent positions, as we will see in a more complicated example later on.\n",

    "Now that we have some intuition built up, let's circle back to random networks. We will call this particular network model the Random Dot Product Graph (RDPG) model. The way that we can think of the $RDPG$ random network is that the edges depend on a latent position matrix $X$. For each pair of nodes $i$ and $j$, we have a unique coin (we will call this the $(i,j)$ coin) which has a $\\vec x_i^\\top \\vec x_j$ chance of landing on heads, and a $1 - \\vec x_i^\\top \\vec x_j$ chance of landing on tails. If the $(i,j)$ coin lands on heads, the edge between nodes $i$ and $j$ exists, and if the $(i,j)$ coin lands on tails, the edge between nodes $i$ and $j$ does not exist. As before, this coin flip is performed independent of the coin flips for all of the other edges. The notation we use here is just what we are used to in the preceding sections. If $\\mathbf A$ is a random network which is $RDPG$ with a latent position matrix $X$, we say that $\\mathbf A$ is an $RDPG_n(X)$ random network. \n",
