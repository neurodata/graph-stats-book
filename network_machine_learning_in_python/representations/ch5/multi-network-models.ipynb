    "# Multiple Network Models\n",

    "Up to this point, we have studied network models which are useful for a single network. What do we do if we have multiple networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine that we have a company with $45$ total employees. $10$ of these employees are company administrative executives, $25$ of these employees are network machine learning experts, and $10$ of these employees are marketing experts. We study the social media habits of our employees on facebook, twitter, and linkedin. For a given social networking site, an edge is said to exist between a pair of employees if they are connected on the social media site (by being friends, following one another, or being connected, respectively). As it turns out, individuals tend to most closely associate with the colleagues whom they work most closely: we might expect some sort of community structure to our network, wherein network machine learning experts are more connected with network machine learning experts, marketing experts are more connected with marketing experts, so on and so forth. What we will see below is that all of the networks appear to have the same community organization, though on Linkedin, we see that the administrative executives tend to be a little more connected. This is reflected in the fact that there are more connections between Adm. members on Linkedin:"

    "Remember that a random network has an adjacency matrix denoted by a boldfaced uppercase $\\mathbf A$, and has network samples $A$ (which we just call \"networks\"). When we have multiple networks, we will need to be able to index them individually. For this reason, in this section, we will use the convention that a random network's adjacency matrix is denoted by a boldfaced uppercase $\\mathbf A^{(m)}$, where $m$ tells us which network in our collection we are talking about. The capital letter $M$ defines the *total* number of random networks in our collection. In our social network example, since we have connection networks for $3$ sites, $N$ is $3$. When we use the letter $m$ itself, we will typically be referring to an arbitrary random network amongst the collection of random networks, where $m$ is between $1$ and $N$. When we have $M$ total networks, we will write down the entire **collection of random networks** using the notation $\\left\\{\\mathbf A^{(1)}, ..., \\mathbf A^{(M)}\\right\\}$. With what we already know, for a random network $\\mathbf A^{(m)}$, we would be able to use a single nework model to describe $\\mathbf A^{(m)}$. This means, for instance, if we thought that each social network could be represented by an RDPG, that we would have a *different* latent position matrix $X^{(m)}$ to define each of the $30$ networks. In symbols, we would write that each $\\mathbf A^{(m)}$ is an RDPG random nework with latent position matrix $X^{(m)}$. What is the problem with this description?\n",
    "\n",
    "What this description lacks is that the three networks share a *lot* of common information. We might expect that, on some level, the latent position matrices should also show some sort of common structure. However, since we used a *unique* latent position matrix $X^{(m)}$ for each random network $\\mathbf A^{(m)}$, we have inherently stated that we think that the networks have completely distinct latent position matrices. If we were to perform a task downstream, such as whether we could identify which employees are in which community, we would have to analyze each latent position matrix individually, and we would not be able to learn a latent position matrix with shared structure across the three networks. Before we jump into multiple network models, let's provide some context as to how we will build these up.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the below descriptions, we will tend to build off the Random Dot Product Graph (RDPG), and closely related variations of it. Why? Well, as it turns out, the RDPG is extremely flexible, in that we can represent both ER and SBMs as RDPGs, too. This means that building off the RDPG gives us multiple random network models that will be inherently flexible. Further, as we will see in the later section on [Estimation](#link?), the RDPG is extremely well-suited for the situation in which we want to analyze SBMs, but do not know which communities the nodes are in ahead of time. This situation is extremely common across numerous disciplines of network machine learning, such as social networking, neuroscience, and many other fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how can we model our collection of random networks with shared structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Joint Random Dot Product Graphs (JRDPG) Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example on social networks, notice that the facebook and twitter connections do not look *too* qualitatively different. It looks like they have relatively similar connectivity patterns between the different employee working groups, and we might even think that the underlying random process that governs these two social networks are *identical*. In statisical science, when we have a collection of $M$ random networks that have the same underlying random process, we describe this with the term **homogeneity**. Let's put what this means into context using our coin flip example. If a pair of coins are *homogeneous*, this means that the probability that they land on heads is identical. Likewise, this intuition extends directly to random networks. A **homogeneous** collection of random networks $\\left\\{\\mathbf A^{(1)}, ..., \\mathbf A^{(M)}\\right\\}$ is one in which *all* of the $M$ random networks have the *same probability matrix*. Remember that the probability matrix $P^{(m)}$ is the matrix whose entries $p^{(m)}_{ij}$ indicate the probability that an edge exists between nodes $i$ and $j$. On the other hand, a **heterogeneous** collection of random networks is a collection of networks $\\left\\{\\mathbf A^{(1)}, ..., \\mathbf A^{(M)}\\right\\}$ is one in which the probability matrices are *not* the same for all of the $M$ networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The probability matrices $P^{(1)}$ and $P^{(2)}$ for the random networks $\\mathbf A^{(1)}$ and $\\mathbf A^{(2)}$ for facebook and twitter are shown in the following figure. We also show the difference between the two probability matrices, to make really clear that they are the same:"

To reflect this heterogeneity, we will need to turn to the COmmon Subspace Independent Edge (COSIE) model.\n",

    "Even though $P^{(1)}$ and $P^{(3)}$ are not *identical*, we can see they still share *some* structure: the employee teams are the same between the two social networks, and much of the probability matrix is unchanged. For this reason, it will be useful for us to have a network model which allows us to convey *some* shared structure, but still lets us convey aspects of the different networks which are *unique*. The COSIE model will accomplish this using a *shared latent position matrix* to describe the *similarities*, and unique *score matrices* to describe the *differences*, for each of the random networks. Let's learn about what these are.\n",

    "The *shared latent position matrix* for the COSIE model is quite similar to the latent position matrix for an RDPG. Like the latent position matrix, the shared latent position matrix $V$ is a matrix with $n$ rows (one for each node) and $d$ columns. The $d$ columns behave very similarly to the $d$ columns ffor the latent position matrix of an RDPG, and $d$ is referred to as the *latent dimensionality* of the COSIE random networks. Like before, each row of the shared latent position matrix $v_i$ will be referred to as the shared latent position vector for node $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also add an additional restriction to $V$: it will be a matrix with orthonormal columns. What this means is that for each column of $V$, the dot product of the column with itself is $1$, and the dot product of the column with any other column is $0$. This has the implication that $V^\\top V = I$, the identity matrix. All this has the effect of doing is it gives us a sense of uniform scale for all of the columns (scale $1$) of the latent position matrix. This has the effect of allowing the other component, the *score matrix*, to be interpretable, which we will learn more about in the next subsection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The shared latent position matrix conveys the *common structure* between the COSIE random networks, and will be a parameter for each of the neworks. Remember that with the $JRDPG_n(X)$ model, we were able to capture the homogeneity of the social networks on facebook and twitter, but we could not capture the heterogeneity of the social nework on linkedin. However, we want the shared latent position matrix $V$ to convey the commonality amongst the three social networks; that is, that the employees are always working on the same employee teams. Let's take a look at the shared latent position matrix $V$ for the social network example:"

The way we can think about the COSIE model is that for each random network that we have, the probability matrix $P^{((m)}$ depends on the shared latent position matrix $V$ and the score matrix $R^{(m)}$. The probability matrix $P^{(m)}$ for the $m^{th}$ random network is defined so that $P^{(m)} = VR^{(m)}V^\\top$. This means that each entry $p_{ij}^{(m)} = \\vec v_i^\\top R^{(m)} \\vec v_j$. We say that a collection of random networks $\\left\\{\\mathbf A^{(1)}, ..., \\mathbf A^{(M)}\\right\\}$ with $n$ nodes is $COSIE_{n,M}\\left(V, \\left\\{R^{(1)},...,R^{(M)}\\right\\}\\right)$ if each random network $\\mathbf A^{(m)}$ is $IER(P^{(m)})$. Stated another way, each of the $N$ random networks share the same orthonormal matrix $V$, but a unique score matrix $R^{(m)}$. This allows the random networks to share some underlying structure (which is conveyed by $V$) but each random network still has a combination of this shared structure (conveyed by $R^{(m)}$). \n",

    "## Correlated Network Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we get to a special case of network models, known as correlated network models. Let's say that we have a group of people in a city, and we know that each people in our group have both a Facebook and a Twitter. The nodes in our network are the people we have. The first network consists of Facebook connections amongst the people, where an edge exists between two people if they are friends on Facebook. The second network consists of Twitter connections amongst the people, where an edge exists between two people if they follow one another on Twitter. We think that if two people are friends on Facebook, there is a good chance that they follow one another on Twitter, and vice versa. How do we reflect this similarity through a multiple network model?\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, network correlation between a pair of networks describes the property that the existence of edges in one network provides us with some level of information about edges in the other network, much like the Facebook/Twitter example we just discussed. In this book, we will focus on the $\\rho$-*correlated* network models. What the $\\rho$-correlated network models focus on is that given two random networks with the same number of nodes, each edge has a correlation of $\\rho$ between the two networks. To define this a little more rigorously, a pair of random networks $\\mathbf A^{(1)}$ and $\\mathbf A^{(2)}$ are called $\\rho$-**correlated** if all of the edges across both networks are mutually independent, except that for all pairs of indices $i$ and $j$, $corr(\\mathbf a_{ij}^{(1)}, \\mathbf a_{ij}^{(2)}) = \\rho$, where $corr(\\mathbf x, \\mathbf y)$ is the Pearson correlation between two random variables $\\mathbf x$ and $\\mathbf y$. In our example, this means that whether two people are friends on Facebook is *correlated* with whether they are following one another on Twitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, the Pearson correlation describes whether one variable being large/small gives information that the other variable is large/small (positive correlation, between $0$ and $1$) or whether one variable being large/small gives information that the other variable will be small/large (negative correlation, between $-1$ and $0$). If the two networks are positively correlated and we know that one of the edges $\\mathbf a_{ij}^{(1)}$ has a value of one, then we have information that $\\mathbf a_{ij}^{(2)}$ might also be one, and vice-versa for taking values of zero. If the two networks are negatively correlated and we know that one of the edges $\\mathbf a_{ij}^{(1)}$ has a value of one, then we have information that $\\mathbf a_{ij}^{(2)}$ might be zero, and vice-versa. If the two networks are not correlated ($\\rho = 0$) we do not learn anything about edges of network two by looking at edges from network one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### $\\rho$-Correlated RDPG\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\rho$-correlated RDPG is the most general correlated network model we will need for the purposes of this book. Remembering that both ER and SBM random networks are special cases of the RDPG (for a given choice of the latent position matrix), the $\\rho$-correlated RDPG can therefore be used to construct $\\rho$-correlated ER and $\\rho$-correlated SBMs, too. The way we can think about the $\\rho$-correlated RDPG is that like for the normal RDPG, a latent position matrix $X$ with $n$ rows and a latent dimensionality of $d$ is used to define the edge-existence probabilities for the networks $\\mathbf A^{(1)}$ and $\\mathbf A^{(2)}$. We begin by defining that $\\mathbf A^{(1)}$ is $RDPG_n(X)$. Next, we define the second network as follows. We use a coin for each edge $(i, j)$, which has a probability that depends on the values that the first network takes. If the edge $\\mathbf a_{ij}^{(1)}$ takes the value of one, then we use a coin which has a probability of landing on heads of $\\vec x_i^\\top \\vec x_j + \\rho(1 - \\vec x_i^\\top \\vec x_j)$. If the edge $\\mathbf a_{ij}^{(1)}$ takes the value of zero, then we use a coin which has a probability of landing on heads of $(1 - \\rho)\\vec x_i^\\top \\vec x_j$. We flip this coin, and if it lands on heads, then the edge $\\mathbf a_{ij}^{(2)}$ takes the value of one. If it lands on tails, then the edge $\\mathbf a_{ij}^{(2)}$ takes the value of zero. If $\\mathbf A^{(1)}$ and $A^{(2)}$ are random networks which are $\\rho$-correlated RDPGs with latent position matrix $X$, we say that the pair $\\left\\{\\mathbf A^{(1)}, A^{(2)}\\right\\}$ are $\\rho-RDPG_n(X)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Simulating samples of $\\rho$-correlated RDPGs\n",
    "1. Determine a latent position matrix $X$, where rows $\\vec x_i$ are the latent position vectors for the nodes $i$.\n",
    "2. Determine a correlation between the two networks of $\\rho$, where $\\rho \\geq -1$ and $\\rho \\leq 1$.\n",
    "3. Simulate a sample $A^{(1)}$ which is a sample  of an $RDPG_n(X)$ random network.\n",
    "4. For each pair of nodes $i$ and $j$:\n",
    "    * If the edge $a_{ij}^{(1)}$ has a value of one, obtain a coin which has a probability of landing on heads of $\\vec x_i^\\top \\vec x_j + \\rho(1 - \\vec x_i^\\top \\vec x_j)$. If the edge $a_{ij}^{(2)}$ has a value of zero, obtain a coin which has a probability of landing on heads of $(1 - \\rho)\\vec x_i^\\top \\vec x_j$.\n",
    "    * Flip the $(i,j)$ coin, andd if it lands on heads, the corresponding entry $a_{ij}^{(2)}$ in the adjacency matrix is $1$. If the coin lands on tails, the corresponding entry $a_{ij}^{(2)}$ is $0$. \n",
