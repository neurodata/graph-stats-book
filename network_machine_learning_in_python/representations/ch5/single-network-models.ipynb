    "# Network Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably the easiest kinds of statistical models for us to think about are the *network models*. These types of models (like the name imples) describe the random processes which you'd find when you're only looking at one network. We can have models which assume all of the nodes connect to each other essentially randomly, models which assume that the nodes are in distinct *communities*, and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important realization to make about statistical models is that a model is *not* a network: it's the random process that *creates* a network. You can sample from a model a bunch of times, and because it's a random process, you'll end up with networks that look a little bit different each time -- but if you sampled a lot of networks and then averaged them, then you'd likely be able to get a reasonable ballpark estimation of what the model that they come from looks like.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's pretend that we have a network, and the network is unweighted (meaning, we only have edges or not-edges) and undirected (meaning, edges connect nodes both ways). It'd have an adjacency matrix which consists of only 1's and 0's, because the only information we care about is whether there's an edge or not. The model that generated this network is pretty straightforward: there's just some universal probability that each node connects to each other node, and there are 10 nodes."

    "As it turns out, \"more\" is a pretty massive understatement. To actually figure out the number, think about the first node: there are two possibilities (weighted or not weighted), so you can generate two networks from a one-node model. Now, let's add an additional node. For each of the first two possibilities, there are two more -- so there are $2 \\times 2 = 4$ total possible networks. Every node that we add doubles the number of networks - and since a network with $n$ nodes has $n \\times n$ edges, the total number of possible networks ends up being $2^{n \\times n} = 2^{n^2}$! So this ten-node model can generate $2^{10^2} = 2^{100}$ networks, which is, when you think carefully, an absurdly, ridiculously big number.\n",

    "To understand network models, it is crucial to understand the concept of a network as a random quantity, taking a probability distribution. We have a realization $A$, and we think that this realization is random in some way. Stated another way, we think that there exists a network-valued random variable $\\mathbf A$ that governs the realizations we get to see. Since $\\mathbf A$ is a random variable, we can describe it using a probability distribution. The distribution of the random network $\\mathbf A$ is the function $\\mathbb P$ which assigns probabilities to every possible configuration that $\\mathbf A$ could take. Notationally, we write that $\\mathbf A \\sim \\mathbb P$, which is read in words as \"the random network $\\mathbf A$ is distributed according to $\\mathbb P$.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "In the preceding description, we made a fairly substantial claim: $\\mathbb P$ assigns probabilities to every possible configuration that realizations of $\\mathbf A$, denoted by $A$, could take. How many possibilities are there for a network with $n$ nodes? Let's limit ourselves to simple networks: that is, $A$ takes values that are unweighted ($A$ is *binary*), undirected ($A$ is *symmetric*), and loopless ($A$ is *hollow*). In words, $\\mathcal A_n$ is the set of all possible adjacency matrices $A$ that correspond to simple networks with $n$ nodes. Stated another way: every $A$ that is found in $\\mathcal A$ is a *binary* $n \\times n$ matrix ($A \\in \\{0, 1\\}^{n \\times n}$), $A$ is symmetric ($A = A^\\top$), and $A$ is *hollow* ($diag(A) = 0$, or $A_{ii} = 0$ for all $i = 1,...,n$). We describe $\\mathcal A_n$ as:\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize the statement that $\\mathbb P$ assigns probabilities to every possible configuration that realizations of $\\mathbf A$ can take, we write that $\\mathbb P : \\mathcal A_n \\rightarrow [0, 1]$. This means that for any $A \\in \\mathcal A_n$ which is a possible realization of a random network $\\mathbf A$, that $\\mathbb P(\\mathbf A = A)$ is a probability (it takes a value between $0$ and $1$). If it is completely unambiguous what the random variable $\\mathbf A$ refers to, we might abbreviate $\\mathbb P(\\mathbf A = A)$ with $\\mathbb P(A)$. This statement can alternatively be read that the probability that the random variable $\\mathbf A$ takes the value $A$ is $\\mathbb P(A)$. Finally, let's address that question we had in the previous paragraph. How many possible adjacency matrices are in $\\mathcal A_n$?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine what just one $A \\in \\mathcal A_n$ can look like. Note that each matrix $A$ has $n \\times n = n^2$ possible entries, in total, since $A$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix. There are $n$ possible self-loops for a network, but since $\\mathbf A$ is simple, it is loopless. This means that we can subtract $n$ possible edges from $n^2$, leaving us with $n^2 - n = n(n-1)$ possible edges that might not be unconnected. If we think in terms of a realization $A$, this means that we are ignoring the diagonal entries $a_{ii}$, for all $i \\in [n]$.  Remember that a simple network is also undirected. In terms of the realization $A$, this means that for every pair $i$ and $j$, that $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$. If we were to learn about an entry in the upper triangle of $A$ where $a_{ij}$ is such that $j > i$, note that we have also learned what $a_{ji}$ is, too. This symmetry of $A$ means that of the $n(n-1)$ entries that are not on the diagonal of $A$, we would, in fact, \"double count\" the possible number of unique values that $A$ could have. This means that $A$ has a total of $\\frac{1}{2}n(n - 1)$ possible entries which are *free*, which is equal to the expression $\\binom{n}{2}$. Finally, note that for each entry of $A$, that the adjacency can take one of two possible values: $0$ or $1$. To write this down formally, for every possible edge which is randomly determined, we have *two* possible values that edge could take. Let's think about building some intuition here:\n",
    "1. If $A$ is $2 \\times 2$, there are $\\binom{2}{2} = 1$ unique entry of $A$, which takes one of $2$ values. There are $2$ possible ways that $A$ could look:\n",

    "How do we generalize this to an arbitrary choice of $n$? The answer is to use *combinatorics*. Basically, the approach is to look at each entry of $A$ which can take different values, and multiply the total number of possibilities by $2$ for every element which can take different values. Stated another way, if there are $2$ choices for each one of $x$ possible items, we have $2^x$ possible ways in which we could select those $x$ items. But we already know how many different elements there are in $A$, so we are ready to come up with an expression for the number. In total, there are $2^{\\binom n 2}$ unique adjacency matrices in $\\mathcal A_n$. Stated another way, the *cardinality* of $\\mathcal A_n$, described by the expression $|\\mathcal A_n|$, is $2^{\\binom n 2}$. The **cardinality** here just means the number of elements that the set $\\mathcal A_n$ contains. When $n$ is just $15$, note that $\\left|\\mathcal A_{15}\\right| = 2^{\\binom{15}{2}} = 2^{105}$, which when expressed as a power of $10$, is more than $10^{30}$ possible networks that can be realized with just $15$ nodes! As $n$ increases, how many unique possible networks are there? In the below figure, look at the value of $|\\mathcal A_n| = 2^{\\binom n 2}$ as a function of $n$. As we can see, as $n$ gets big, $|\\mathcal A_n|$ grows really really fast!"

    "So, now we know that we have probability distributions on networks, and a set $\\mathcal A_n$ which defines all of the adjacency matrices that every probability distribution must assign a probability to.

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we will simplify $\\mathcal P$ through something called *parametrization*. We define $\\Theta$ to be the set of all possible parameters of the random network model, and $\\theta \\in \\Theta$ is a particular parameter choice that governs the parameters of a specific network-valued random variaable $\\mathbf A$. In this case, we will write $\\mathcal P$ as the set:\n",

    "\n",
    "If you are used to traditional univariate or multivariate statistical modelling, an extremely natural choice for when you have a discrete sample space (like $\\mathcal A_n$, which is discrete because we can count it) would be to use a categorical model. In the categorical model, we would have a single parameter for all possible configurations of an $n$-node network; that is, $|\\theta| = \\left|\\mathcal A_n\\right| = 2^{\\binom n 2}$. What is wrong with this model? The limitations are two-fold:\n",
    "1. As we explained previously, when $n$ is just $15$, we would need over $10^{30}$ bits of storage just to define $\\theta$. This amounts to more than $10^{8}$ zetabytes, which exceeds the storage capacity of *the entire world*.\n",
    "2. With a single network observed (or really, any number of networks we could collect in the real world) we would never be able to get a reasonable estimate of $2^{\\binom n 2}$ parameters for any reasonably non-trivial number of nodes $n$. For the case of one observed network $A$, an estimate of $\\theta$ (referred to as $\\hat\\theta$) would simply be for $\\hat\\theta$ to have a $1$ in the entry corresponding to our observed network, and a $0$ everywhere else. Inferentially, this would imply that the network-valued random variable $\\mathbf A$ which governs realizations $A$ is deterministic, even if this is not the case. Even if we collected potentially *many* observed networks, we would still (with very high probability) just get $\\hat \\theta$ as a series of point masses on the observed networks we see, and $0$s everywhere else. This would mean our parameter estimates $\\hat\\theta$ would not generalize to new observations at *all*, with high probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what are some more reasonable descriptions of $\\mathcal P$? We explore some choices below. Particularly, we will be most interested in the *independent-edge* networks. These are the families of networks in which the generative procedure which governs the random networks assume that the edges of the network are generated *independently*. **Statistical Independence** is a property which greatly simplifies many of the modelling assumptions which are crucial for proper estimation and rigorous statistical inference, which we will learn more about in the later chapters.\n",

    "### Equivalence Classes*\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of the below models, we will explore the concept of the **probability equivalence class**, or an *equivalence class*, for short. The probability is a function which in general, describes how effective a particular observation can be described by a random variable $\\mathbf A$ with parameters $\\theta$, written $\\mathbf A \\sim F(\\theta)$. The probability will be used to describe the probability $\\mathbb P_\\theta(\\mathbf A)$ of observing the realization $A$ if the underlying random variable $\\mathbf A$ has parameters $\\theta$.  Why does this matter when it comes to equivalence classes? An equivalence class is a subset of the sample space $E \\subseteq \\mathcal A_n$, which has the following properties. Holding the parameters $\\theta$ fixed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If $A$ and $A'$ are members of the same equivalence class $E$ (written $A, A' \\in E$), then $\\mathbb P_\\theta(A) = \\mathbb P_\\theta(A')$. \n",
    "2. If $A$ and $A''$ are members of different equivalence classes; that is, $A \\in E$ and $A'' \\in E'$ where $E, E'$ are equivalence classes, then $\\mathbb P_\\theta(A) \\neq \\mathbb P_\\theta(A'')$.\n",
    "3. Using points 1 and 2, we can establish that if $E$ and $E'$ are two different equivalence classes, then $E \\cap E' = \\varnothing$. That is, the equivalence classes are **mutually disjoint**.\n",
    "4. We can use the preceding properties to deduce that given the sample space $\\mathcal A_n$ and a probability function $\\mathbb P_\\theta$, we can define a partition of the sample space into equivalence classes $E_i$, where $i \\in \\mathcal I$ is an arbitrary indexing set. A **partition** of $\\mathcal A_n$ is a sequence of sets which are mutually disjoint, and whose union is the whole space. That is, $\\bigcup_{i \\in \\mathcal I} E_i = \\mathcal A_n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will see more below about how the equivalence classes come into play with network models, and in a later section, we will see their relevance to the estimation of the parameters $\\theta$.\n",

    "(representations:whyuse:networkmodels:iern)=\n",
    "### Independent-Edge Random Networks*\n",
    "\n",
    "The below models are all special families of something called **independent-edge random networks**. An independent-edge random network is a network-valued random variable, in which the collection of edges are all independent. In words, this means that for every adjacency $\\mathbf a_{ij}$ of the network-valued random variable $\\mathbf A$, that $\\mathbf a_{ij}$ is independent of $\\mathbf a_{i'j'}$, any time that $(i,j) \\neq (i',j')$. When the networks are simple, the easiest thing to do is to assume that each edge $(i,j)$ is connected with some probability (which might be different for each edge) $p_{ij}$. We use the $ij$ subscript to denote that this probability is not necessarily the same for each edge. This simple model can be described as $\\mathbf a_{ij}$ has the distribution $Bern(p_{ij})$, for every $j > i$, and is independent of every other edge in $\\mathbf A$. We only look at the entries $j > i$, since our networks are simple. This means that knowing a realization of $\\mathbf a_{ij}$ also gives us the realizaaion of $\\mathbf a_{ji}$ (and thus $\\mathbf a_{ji}$ is a *deterministic* function of $\\mathbf a_{ij}$). Further, we know that the random network is loopless, which means that every $\\mathbf a_{ii} = 0$. We will call the matrix $P = (p_{ij})$ the **probability matrix** of the network-valued random variable $\\mathbf A$. In general, we will see a common theme for the probabilities of a realization $A$ of a network-valued random variable $\\mathbf A$, which is that it will greatly simplify our computation. Remember that if $\\mathbf x$ and $\\mathbf y$ are binary variables which are independent, that $\\mathbb P(\\mathbf x = x, \\mathbf y = y) = \\mathbb P(\\mathbf x = x) \\mathbb P(\\mathbf y = y)$. Using this fact:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\mathbb P(\\mathbf A = A) &= \\mathbb P(\\mathbf a_{11} = a_{11}, \\mathbf a_{12} = a_{12}, ..., \\mathbf a_{nn} = a_{nn}) \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\mathbb P(\\mathbf a_{ij} = a_{ij} \\text{ for all }j > i) \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\prod_{j > i}\\mathbb P(\\mathbf a_{ij} = a_{ij}), \\;\\;\\;\\;\\textrm{Independence Assumption}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Next, we will use the fact that if a random variable $\\mathbf a_{ij}$ has the Bernoulli distribution with probability $p_{ij}$, that $\\mathbb P(\\mathbf a_{ij} = a_{ij}) = p_{ij}^{a_{ij}}(1 - p_{ij})^{1 - p_{ij}}$:\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've specified a probability and a very generalizable model, we've learned the full story behind network models and are ready to skip to estimating parameters, right? *Wrong!* Unfortunately, if we tried too estimate anything about each $p_{ij}$ individually, we would obtain that $p_{ij} = a_{ij}$ if we only have one realization $A$. Even if we had many realizations of $\\mathbf A$, this still would not be very interesting, since we have a *lot* of $p_{ij}$s to estimate, and we've ignored any sort of structural model that might give us deeper insight into $\\mathbf A$. In the below sections, we will learn successively less restrictive (and hence, *more expressive*) assumptions about $p_{ij}$s, which will allow us to convey fairly complex random networks, but *still* enable us with plenty of intteresting things to learn about later on."

In an ER network, each pair of nodes is connected with probability $p$, and therefore not connected with probability $1-p$. Statistically, we say that for each edge $\\mathbf{a}_{ij}$, that $\\mathbf{a}_{ij}$ is sampled independently and identically from a $Bern(p)$ distribution, whenever $j > i$. The word \"independent\" means that edges in the network occurring or not occurring do not affect one another. For instance, this means that if we knew a student named Alice was friends with Bob, and Alice was also friends with Chadwick, that we do not learn any information about whether Bob is friends with Chadwick. The word \"identical\" means that every edge in the network has the same probability $p$ of being connected. If Alice and Bob are friends with probability $p$, then Alice and Chadwick are friends with probability $p$, too. When $i > j$, we allow $\\mathbf a_{ij} = \\mathbf a_{ji}$. This means that the connections *across the diagonal* of the adjacency matrix are all equal, which means that we have built-in the property of undirectedness into our networks. Also, we let $\\mathbf a_{ii} = 0$, which means that all self-loops are always unconnected. This means that all the networks are loopless, and consequently the adjacency matrices are hollow. If $\\mathbf A$ is the adjacency matrix for an ER network with probability $p$, we write that $\\mathbf A \\sim ER_n(p)$."

    "### Practical Utility\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the ER model seems like it might be a little too simple to be useful. Why would it ever be useful to think that the best we can do to describe our network is to say that connections exist with some probability? Does this miss a *lot* of useful questions we might want to answer? Fortunately, there are a number of ways in which the simplicity of the ER model is useful. Given a probability and a number of nodes, we can easily describe the properties we would expect to see in a network if that network were ER. For instance, we know how many edges on average the nodes of an ER nework should have. We can reverse this idea, too: given a network we think might *not* be ER, we could check whether it's different in some way from a network which is ER. For instance, if we see that half the nodes have a ton of edges (meaning, they have a high degree), and half don't, we should probably use a more complicated model than an Erdos-Renyi. If this is the case, we might look for other models that could describe our network which are more complex.\n",

    "Suppose that $\\mathbf A$ is a simple network which is random. The network has $n$ nodes $\\mathcal V = (v_i)_{i = 1}^n$. Recall that the in a simple network, the node degree is $deg(v_i) = \\sum_{j = 1}^n \\mathbf a_{ij}$. What is the expected degree of a node $v_i$ of a random network $\\mathbf A$ which is Erd&ouml;s-R&eacute;nyi?\n",
    "\n",
    "To describe this, we will compute the expectated value of the degree $deg(v_i)$, written $\\mathbb E\\left[deg(v_i)\\right]$. Let's see what happens:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\mathbb E\\left[deg(v_i)\\right] &= \\mathbb E\\left[\\sum_{j = 1}^n \\mathbf a_{ij}\\right] \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\sum_{j = 1}^n \\mathbb E[\\mathbf a_{ij}]\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "We use the *linearity of expectation* in the line above, which means that the expectation of a sum with a finite number of terms being summed over ($n$, in this case) is the sum of the expectations. Finally, by definition, all of the edges $A_{ij}$ have the same distribution: $Bern(p)$. The expected value of a random quantity which takes a Bernoulli distribution is just the probability $p$. This means every term $\\mathbb E[\\mathbf a_{ij}] = p$. Therefore:\n",

    "\n",
    "<!-- The ER model is also useful for the development of new computational techniques to use on random networks. This is because even if the \"best\" model for a network is something much more complex, we can still calculate an edge probability $p$ for the network without needing any information but the adjacency matrix. Consider, for instance, a case where we design a new algorithm for a social network, and we want to know how much more RAM we might need as the social network grows. We might want to investigate how the algorithm scales to networks with different numbers of people and different connection probabilities that might be realistic as our social network expands in popularity. Examining how the algorithm operates on ER networks with different values of $n$ and $p$ might be helpful. This is an especially common approach when people deal with networks that are said to be *sparse*. A **sparse network** is a network in which the number of edges is much less than the total possible number of edges. This contrasts with a **dense network**, which is a network in which the number of edges is close to the maximum number of possible edges. In the case of an $ER_{n}(p)$ network, the network is sparse when $p$ is small (closer to $0$), and dense when $p$ is large (closer to $1$). -->\n",

Here, we have two *clusters* of coin flips, those that occur with the first coin, and those that occur with the second coin. Since the first cluster of coin flips are with a fair coin, we expect that coin flips from the first cluster will not necessarily have an identical number of heads and tails, but at least a similar number of heads and tails.

Intuitively, if two students go to the same school, it might make sense to say that they have a higher chance of being friends than if they do not go to the same school. If we were to try to characterize this network using an ER network, we would run into a problem very similar to when we tried to capture the two cluster coin flip example with only a single coin.

    "The Stochastic Block Model, or SBM, captures this idea by assigning each of the $n$ nodes in the network to one of $K$ communities. A **community** is a group of nodes within the network. In our example case, the communities would represent the schools that students are able to attend in our network. In an SBM, instead of describing all pairs of nodes with a fixed probability like with the ER model, we instead describe properties that hold for edges between *pairs of communities*. In this sense, for a given school, we could think of the network that describes that school's students as ER.\n",

    "### *A Priori* Stochastic Block Model\n",

    "The *a priori* SBM is an SBM in which we know *a priori* (that is, ahead of time) which nodes are in which communities. Here, we will use the variable $K$ to denote the maximum number of different communities. The ordering of the communities does not matter; the community we call $1$ versus $2$ versus $K$ is largely a symbolic distinction (the only thing that matters is that they are *different*). The *a priori* SBM has the following parameter:\n",

    "| Parameter | Space | Description |\n",

    "| $B$ | [0,1]$^{K \\times K}$ | The block matrix, which assigns edge probabilities for pairs of communities |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To describe the *a priori* SBM, we will use a latent variable model. To do so, we will assume there is some vector-valued random variable, $\\vec{\\pmb \\tau}$, which we will call the **node assignment vector**. This random variable takes values $\\vec\\tau$ which are in the space $\\{1,...,K\\}^n$. That means that each element of a realization $\\vec\\tau$ takes one of $K$ possible values. Each node receives a community assignment, so we say that $i$ goes from $1$ to $n$. Stated another way, each node $i$ of our network receives an assignment $\\tau_i$ to one of the $K$ communities. This model is called the *a priori* SBM because we use it when we have a realization $\\vec\\tau$ that we know ahead of time. In our social network example, for instance, $\\tau_i$ would reflect that each student can attend one of two possible schools. For a single node $i$ that is in community $\\ell$, where $\\ell \\in \\{1, ..., K\\}$, we write that $\\tau_i = \\ell$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's discuss the matrix $B$, which is known as the **block matrix** of the SBM. We write down that $B \\in [0, 1]^{K \\times K}$, which means that the block matrix is a matrix with $K$ rows and $K$ columns. If we have a pair of nodes and know which of the $K$ communities each node is from, the block matrix tells us the probability that those two nodes are connected. If our networks are simple, the matrix $B$ is also symmetric, which means that if $b_{kk'} = p$ where $p$ is a probability, that $b_{k'k} = p$, too. The requirement of $B$ to be symmetric exists *only* if we are dealing with simple networks, since they are undirected; if we relax the requirement of undirectedness (and allow directed networks) $B$ no longer need be symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let's think about how to write down the generative model for the *a priori* SBM. Intuitionally what we want to reflect is, if we know that node $i$ is in community $\\ell$ and node $j$ is in community $k$, that the $(\\ell, k)$ entry of the block matrix is the probability that $i$ and $j$ are connected. We say that given  $\\tau_i = k'$ and $\\tau_j = k$, $\\mathbf a_{ij}$ is sampled independently from a $Bern(b_{k' k})$ distribution for all $j > i$. Note that the adjacencies $\\mathbf a_{ij}$ are not *necessarily* identically distributed, because the probability depends on the community of edge $(i,j)$. If $\\mathbf A$ is an *a priori* SBM network with parameter $B$, and $\\vec{\\tau}$ is a realization of the node-assignment vector, we write that $\\mathbf A \\sim SBM_{n,\\vec \\tau}(B)$.\n",

We will begin by thinking about the *a priori* SBM, since it's a little more straightforward to generate samples. Remember the *a priori* SBM is the SBM where already have a realization of $\\vec{\\pmb \\tau}$ ahead of time. We don't really care too much about the ordering of the students for now, so let's just assume that the first $150$ students all go to the first school, and the second $150$ students all go to the second school. \n",

Further, there's another thing that we want our $\\vec\\pi$ to have: in order for each element $\\pi_k$ to indicate the probability of something to be assigned to $k$, we need all of the $\\pi_k$s to sum up to one.

When we say this network is *modular*, we mean that it looks block-y, in that there are clusters of edges sharing a similar probability. Also, $P$ captures the probability of connections between each pair of students. Indeed, it is the case that $P$ contains the information of both $\\vec\\tau$ and $B$. This means that we can write down a generative model by specifying *only* $P$, and we no longer need to specify $\\vec\\tau$ and $B$ at all. To write down the generative model in this way, we say that for all $j > i$, that $\\mathbf a_{ij} \\sim Bern(p_{ij})$ independently, where $\\mathbf a_{ji} = \\mathbf a_{ij}$, and $\\mathbf a_{ii} = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is so special about this formulation of the SBM problem? As it turns out, for a *positive semi-definite* probability matrix $P$, $P$ can be decomposed using a matrix $X$, where $P = X X^\\top$. We will call a single row of $X$ the vector $\\vec x_i$. Remember, using this expression, each entry $p_{ij}$ is the product $\\vec x_i^\\top \\vec x_j$, for all $i, j$. Like $P$, $X$ has $n$ rows, each of which corresponds to a single node in our network. However, the special property of $X$ is that it doesn't *necessarily* have $n$ columns: rather, $X$ often will have many fewer columns than rows. For instance, with $P$ defined as above, there in fact exists an $X$ with just $2$ columns that can be used to describe $P$. This matrix $X$ will be called the **latent position matrix**, and each row $\\vec x_i$ will be called the **latent position of a node**. . We  Like previously, there are two types of RDPGs: one in which $X$ is treated as *known*, and another in which $X$ is treated as *unknown*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, your next thought might be that this requires a *lot* more space to represent an SBM network, and you'd be right: $\\vec \\tau$ has $n$ entries, and $B$ has $K \\times K$ entries, where $K$ is typically much smaller than $n$. On the other hand, in this formulation, $P$ has $\\binom{n}{2}$ entries, which is much bigger than $n + K \\times K$ (since $K$ is usually much smaller than $n$). The advantage is that under this formulation, $P$ doesn't need to have this rigorous modular structure characteristic of SBM networks, and can look a *lot* more interesting. As we will see in later chapters, this network representation will prove extremely flexible for allowing us to capture networks that are fairly complex. Further, we can also perform analysis on the matrix $X$ itself, which will prove very useful for estimation of SBMs."

The nodes of our network represent the people who live along our assumed street. If two people are closer to one another, it might make sense to think that they have a higher probability of being friends.

    "\n",
    "The Generalized Random Dot Product Graph, or GRDPG, is the most general random network model we will consider in this book. Note that for the RDPG, the probability matrix $P$ had entries $p_{ij} = \\vec x_i^\\top \\vec x_j$. What about $p_{ji}$? Well, $p_{ji} = \\vec x_j^\\top \\vec x_i$, which is exactly the same as $p_{ij}$! This means that even if we were to consider a directed RDPG, the probabilities that can be captured are *always* going to be symmetric. The generalized random dot product graph, or GRDPG, relaxes this assumption. This is achieved by using *two* latent positin matrices, $X$ and $Y$, and letting $P = X Y^\\top$. Now, the entries $p_{ij} = \\vec x_i^\\top \\vec y_j$, but $p_{ji} = \\vec x_j^\\top \\vec y_i$, which might be different.\n",

    "### *A Priori* GRDPG\n",
    "\n",
    "The *a priori* GRDPG is a GRDPG in which we know *a priori* the latent position matrices $X$ and $Y$. The *a priori* GRDPG has the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Parameter | Space | Description |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| $X$ | $ \\mathbb R^{n \\times d}$ | The matrix of left latent positions for each node $n$. |\n",
    "| $Y$ | $ \\mathbb R^{n \\times d}$ | The matrix of right latent positions for each node $n$. |\n",
    "\n",
    "$X$ and $Y$ behave nearly the same as the latent position matrix $X$ for the *a priori* RDPG, with the exception that they will be called the **left latent position matrix** and the **right latent position matrix** respectively. Further, the vectors $\\vec x_i$ will be the left latent positions, and $\\vec y_i$ will be the right latent positions, for a given node $i$, for each node $i=1,...,n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the generative model for the *a priori* GRDPG? As we discussed above, given $X$ and $Y$, for all $j \\neq i$, $\\mathbf a_{ij} \\sim Bern(\\vec x_i^\\top \\vec y_j)$ independently. If we consider only loopless networks, $\\mathbf a_{ij} = 0$. If $\\mathbf A$ is an *a priori* GRDPG with left and right latent position matrices $X$ and $Y$, we write that $\\mathbf A \\sim GRDPG_n(X, Y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *A Posteriori* GRDPG\n",
    "\n",
    "The *A Posteriori* GRDPG is very similar to the *a posteriori* RDPG. We have two parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Parameter | Space | Description |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| F | inner-product distributions | A distribution which governs the left latent positions. |\n",
    "| G | inner-product distributions | A distribution which governs the right latent positions. |\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we treat the left and right latent position matrices as latent variable matrices, like we did for *a posteriori* RDPG. That is, the left latent positions are sampled independently and identically from $F$, and the right latent positions $\\vec y_i$ are sampled independently and identically from $G$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model for edges of the *a posteriori* RDPG can be described by conditioning on the unobserved left and right latent-position matrices. We write down that, conditioned on $\\vec {\\mathbf x}_i = \\vec x$ and $\\vec {\\mathbf y}_j = \\vec y$, that if $j \\neq i$, then $\\mathbf a_{ij}$ is sampled independently from a $Bern(\\vec x^\\top \\vec y)$ distribution. As before, assuming the network is loopless, $\\mathbf a_{ii} = 0$. If $\\mathbf A$ is the adjacency matrix for an *a posteriori* RDPG with parameter $F$, we write that $\\mathbf A \\sim GRDPG_n(F, G)$. \n"
