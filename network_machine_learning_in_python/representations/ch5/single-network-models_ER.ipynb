    "This simple random network model is called the Erd&ouml;s R&eacute;nyi (ER) model<sup>1</sup>. The way we can think of an ER random network is that the edges depend *only* on a probability, $p$, and each edge is totally independent of all other edges. We can think of this example as though a coin flip is performed, where the coin has a probability $p$ of landing on heads, and $1-p$ of landing on tails. For each edge in the network, we conceptually flip the coin, and if it lands on heads (with probability $p$), the edge exists, and if it lands on tails (with probability $1-p$) the edge does not exist. If $\\mathbf A$ is a random network which is $ER_n(p)$ with $n$ nodes and probability $p$, we will often say that $\\mathbf A$ is an $ER_n(p)$ random network. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach which we will use to describe random networks is called a *generative model*, which means that we have described an observable network realization $A$ of the random network $\\mathbf A$ in terms of the parameters of $\\mathbf A$. In the case of the $ER_n(p)$ random networks, we have described $\\mathbf A$ in terms of the probability parameter, $p$. Generative models are convenient in that we can easily adapt them to tell us exactly how to simulate realizations of the underlying random network. The procedure below will produce for us a network $A$, which has nodes and edges, where the underlying random network  $\\mathbf A$ is an $ER_n(p)$ random network:\n",

    "## When do we use an $ER_n(p)$ Network?\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the $ER_n(p)$ model seems like it might be a little too simple to be useful. Why would it ever be useful to think that the best we can do to describe our network is to say that connections exist with some probability? Does this miss a *lot* of useful questions we might want to answer? Fortunately, there are a number of ways in which the simplicity of the $ER_n(p)$ model is useful. Given a probability and a number of nodes, we can easily describe the properties we would expect to see in a network if that network were ER. For instance, we know how many edges on average the nodes of an $ER_n(p)$ random nework should have. We can reverse this idea, too: given a network we think might *not* be ER, we could check whether it's different in some way from an $ER_n(p)$ random network. For instance, if we see that half the nodes have a ton of edges (meaning, they have a high degree), and half don't, we might be able to determine that the network is poorly described by an $ER_n(p)$ random network. If this is the case, we might look for other models that could describe our network which are more complex. \n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Another utility of the $ER_n(p)$ model is that we might often want to benchmark network algorithms on simulated networks with a given *sparsity*. **Network sparsity** is a feature of a network which describes the degree to which the network possesses fewer edges than the maximum number of possible edges. As an example, when we know ahead of time that the network is going to be sparse (the network has a *small* number of edges which exist relative the number of possible edges), we can use network machine learning techniques which anticipate this sparsity to make the algorithm faster. In a simple network, for instance, the maximum number of possible edges is $\\binom n 2$. In an $ER_n(p)$ network with probability $p$, we would expect the network to have on average about $p \\binom n 2$ edges; that is, $p$ describes the fraction of total possible edges that we would expect to exist. $ER_n(p)$ networks are extremely cheap to simulate computationally, because \"flipping weighted coins\" (if you are curious, this is called a *Bernoulli sample* with probability $p$) is usually able to be performed with extremely optimized code in most standard programming languages such as python. Being able to generate networks very easily with a given number of nodes $n$ and a given sparsity allows us to test just how efficient our network machine learning technique is.\n",
