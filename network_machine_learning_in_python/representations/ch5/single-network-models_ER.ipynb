    "From here on out, when we talk about an Erd&ouml;s R&eacute;nyi random variable, we will simply call it an ER network. In an ER network, each pair of nodes is connected with probability $p$, and therefore not connected with probability $1-p$. Statistically, we say that for each edge $\\mathbf{a}_{ij}$ for every pair of nodes where $j > i$ (in terms of the adjacency matrix, this means all of the edges in the *upper right* triangle), that $\\mathbf{a}_{ij}$ is sampled independently and identically from a *Bernoulli* distribution with probability $p$. The word \"independent\" means that edges in the network occurring or not occurring do not affect one another. For instance, this means that if we knew a student named Alice was friends with Bob, and Alice was also friends with Chadwick, that we do not learn any information about whether Bob is friends with Chadwick. The word \"identical\" means that every edge in the network has the same probability $p$ of being connected. If Alice and Bob are friends with probability $p$, then Alice and Chadwick are friends with probability $p$, too. We assume here that the networks are undirected, which means that if an edge $\\mathbf a_{ij}$ exists from node $i$ to $j$, then the edge $\\mathbf a_{ji}$ also exists from node $j$ to node $i$. We also assume that the networks are loopless, which means that no edges $\\mathbf a_{ii}$ can go from node $i$ to itself. If $\\mathbf A$ is the adjacency matrix for an ER network with probability $p$, we write that $\\mathbf A \\sim ER_n(p)$."

    "## Practical Utility\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the ER model seems like it might be a little too simple to be useful. Why would it ever be useful to think that the best we can do to describe our network is to say that connections exist with some probability? Does this miss a *lot* of useful questions we might want to answer? Fortunately, there are a number of ways in which the simplicity of the ER model is useful. Given a probability and a number of nodes, we can easily describe the properties we would expect to see in a network if that network were ER. For instance, we know how many edges on average the nodes of an ER nework should have. We can reverse this idea, too: given a network we think might *not* be ER, we could check whether it's different in some way from a network which is ER. For instance, if we see that half the nodes have a ton of edges (meaning, they have a high degree), and half don't, we should probably use a more complicated model than an Erdos-Renyi. If this is the case, we might look for other models that could describe our network which are more complex.\n",

    "Suppose that $\\mathbf A$ is a simple network which is random. The network has $n$ nodes $\\mathcal V = (v_i)_{i = 1}^n$. Recall that the in a simple network, the node degree is $deg(v_i) = \\sum_{j = 1}^n \\mathbf a_{ij}$. What is the expected degree of a node $v_i$ of a random network $\\mathbf A$ which is Erd&ouml;s-R&eacute;nyi?\n",
    "\n",
    "To describe this, we will compute the expectated value of the degree $deg(v_i)$, written $\\mathbb E\\left[deg(v_i)\\right]$. Let's see what happens:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\mathbb E\\left[deg(v_i)\\right] &= \\mathbb E\\left[\\sum_{j = 1}^n \\mathbf a_{ij}\\right] \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\sum_{j = 1}^n \\mathbb E[\\mathbf a_{ij}]\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "We use the *linearity of expectation* in the line above, which means that the expectation of a sum with a finite number of terms being summed over ($n$, in this case) is the sum of the expectations. Finally, by definition, all of the edges $A_{ij}$ have the same distribution: $Bern(p)$. The expected value of a random quantity which takes a Bernoulli distribution is just the probability $p$. This means every term $\\mathbb E[\\mathbf a_{ij}] = p$. Therefore:\n",

    "    \\mathbb E\\left[deg(v_i)\\right] &= \\sum_{j = 1}^n p = n\\cdot p\n",

    "\n",
    "<!-- The ER model is also useful for the development of new computational techniques to use on random networks. This is because even if the \"best\" model for a network is something much more complex, we can still calculate an edge probability $p$ for the network without needing any information but the adjacency matrix. Consider, for instance, a case where we design a new algorithm for a social network, and we want to know how much more RAM we might need as the social network grows. We might want to investigate how the algorithm scales to networks with different numbers of people and different connection probabilities that might be realistic as our social network expands in popularity. Examining how the algorithm operates on ER networks with different values of $n$ and $p$ might be helpful. This is an especially common approach when people deal with networks that are said to be *sparse*. A **sparse network** is a network in which the number of edges is much less than the total possible number of edges. This contrasts with a **dense network**, which is a network in which the number of edges is close to the maximum number of possible edges. In the case of an $ER_{n}(p)$ network, the network is sparse when $p$ is small (closer to $0$), and dense when $p$ is large (closer to $1$). -->\n",
