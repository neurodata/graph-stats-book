    "Networks by themselves can have interesting properties, but a network is not how you traditionally organize data in computer science. In almost any ML algorithm - whether you're using a neural network or a decision tree, whether your goal is to classify observations or to predict values using regression - you'll see data organized into a matrix, where the rows represent observations and the columns represent features, or variables. Each observation, or row of the matrix, is traditionally represented as a single point in $d$-dimensional space (if there are $d$ columns in the matrix). If you have two columns, for instance, you could represent data organized in this way on an x/y coordinate plane. The first column would represent the x-axis, and the second column would represent the y-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the data below is organized traditionally. On the left is the data matrix; each observation has its own row, with two features across the columns. The first column contains the first feature for each observation, and the second column contains the second feature for each observation. You can see the two clusters of data numerically, through the color mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the right is the same data, but plotted in Euclidean space. Each column of the data matrix gets its own axis in the plot. The x and y axis location of the $i^{th}$ point in the scatterplot is the same as the first and second feature values of the $i^{th}$ row of the data matrix. You can see the two clusters of data geometrically, through the location of the observations as points in the scatter plot."

You could view each element of an adjacency matrix as its own (binary, for unweighted networks) dimension, for instance -- although you could also make the argument that talking about dimensionality doesn't even make *sense* with network data, since it doesn't live in Euclidean space. Regardless, if you were to view the elements of the adjacency matrix as their own dimensions, you can get to a fairly unmanageable number of dimensions fairly quickly -- in fact, for a simple network, the number of dimensions is $\\binom n 2$, as you learned back in [Chapter 4](ch4:prop:net-dens). Many dimensions can generally be unmanageable largely because of a machine learning concept called the *curse of dimensionality*, described in [Elements of Statistical Learning](#https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Statistical-Learning-Prediction-Statistics/dp/0387848576/ref=asc_df_0387848576/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312140868236&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=7340427778028014499&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9007909&hvtargid=pla-487139763557&psc=1).\n",

Of these lobsters, you know whether they are male or female, and you also know the total length of the lobster. As it turns out, male lobsters have *substantially* larger claws than female lobsters. You want to learn whether, given whether a lobster is male or female and its length, can you predict its claw size? Let's start by importing in the dataset we will be using.

Here, the nodes are the students, and the edges are whether or not a pair of students are friends. If you knew that the school president was extremely popular, then all of the edges in the network that are associated with the school president are also *interacting*, in that if you knew that an edge had a node which represented the school president, it would be *much* more likely to exist (since the school president has many friends). While this would be an extreme example, as you can see, these sorts of *dependences* can permeate through the entire network. If Alice is friends with Bob and Bob is friends with Desean, it might make sense to think that Alice might be more likely to be friends with Desean too.

You can embed your network, and doing *nothing else*, answer questions you might have about it. There is, however, another role that embedding has. If you make some assumptions about the network, you can also use embeddings to *learn* valuable representations of your data that will allow you to answer more formal questions than you could using simple, out-of-the-box machine learning algorithms. Using embeddings coupled with statistical models, you can *estimate* parameters for the statistical models you learned about in [Chapter 5](ch5), and then use statistical properties about these parameters to perform *model-based* inference."

    "It's good to emphasize here that we're modeling our networks as *random dot-product graphs* (RDPGs). One implication is that you can think of a network as having some underlying probability distribution, and any specific network is one of many possible realizations of that distribution. It also means that each edge in our network has some *probability* of existing: nodes 0 and 3, for instance, may or may not have an edge. The concept of a latent position only makes sense under the assumption that the network is drawn from an RDPG.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to state this again just to emphasize the importance of the last sentence. You most certainly *can* embed a network without assuming the network is an RDPG. However, the resulting embedding derives an interpretation, which goes *beyond* the scope of simply being a set of points in $d$ dimensions, when you make an assumption that the network is a RDPG. We will cover this particularity more in depth over the next few sections. "

    "Similarly, you can find an estimate of the probability matrix $\\hat P$ for your network using the latent positions. How would you generate $\\hat P$ from $\\hat X$?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, you'd just multiply it by its transpose: $\\hat P = \\hat X\\hat X^\\top$. This operation will take the dot product between every row of $X$ and put it in the result. $(\\hat X\\hat X^\\top)_{ij}$ will just be the dot product between rows $i$ and $j$ of the estimated latent position matrix (which is the estimated probability that nodes $i$ and $j$ will be connected). So, $\\hat X\\hat X^\\top$ is just the $n \\times n$ estimated probability matrix - if you've estimated your latent positions using samples of networks, you can also estimate the probability matrix."

    "You can also think about this stuff geometrically. The dot product between any two vectors $\\vec x_i$ and $\\vec x_j$, geometrically, is their lengths multiplied together and then weighted by the cosine of the angle between them. Smaller angles have cosines close to 1, and larger angles have cosines close to 0. So, nodes whose latent positions have larger angles between them tend to have lower edge probabilities, and nodes whose latent positions have smaller angles between them tend to have higher edge probabilities. This is the core intuition you need to understand as to why you can find communities and do downstream inference with latent position matrices: two nodes whose latent positions are further apart will have a smaller probability of having an edge between them! This particular topic, called [Community Detection](ch7:comm_detect), will arise later in the applications section of the book."
