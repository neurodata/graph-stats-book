    "Say you're a brain researcher, and you have a bunch of scans of brains - some are scans of people, and some are scans of aliens. You have some code that estimates networks from your scans, so you turn all your scans into networks. The nodes represent the brain regions which are common to both humans and aliens (isn't evolution amazing?), and the edges represent communication between these brain regions. You want to know if the human and alien networks share a common grouping of regions (your research topic is titled, \"Do Alien Brains Have The Same Hemispheres That We Do?\"). What do you do? How do you even deal with situations in which you have a lot of networks whose nodes all represent the same objects, but whose edges might come from totally different distributions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, if your goal is to find the shared grouping of regions between the human and alien networks, you could try embedding your networks and then seeing what those embeddings look like. This would serve the dual purpose of having less stuff to deal with and having some way to directly compare all of your networks in the same space. Finding an embedding is also simply useful in general, because embedding a network or group of networks opens the door to machine learning methods designed for tabular data.\n",

    "For example, say you have four alien networks and four human networks. Since alien brain networks aren't currently very accessible, we'll just simulate our human and alien networks with Stochastic Block Models. The communities that we're trying to group all of the brain regions into are the two hemispheres of the brain. We'll design the human brains to have strong connections within hemispheres, and we'll design the alien brains to have strong connections between hemispheres -- but the same regions still correspond to the same hemispheres.\n",

However, edge probabilities might change depending on the network. In the first network, you might have nodes in the same community having a high chance of connecting to each other, whereas in the second network, nodes are much more likely to be connected to other nodes in different communities. You want to end up with a classification that distinctly groups the nodes into their respective communities, using the information from all of the networks.

   "source": [
    "Fundamentally, the omnibus embedding is useful is because it lets you avoid the somewhat annoying and noise-generating process of figuring out a good way to rotate your separate embeddings to line them up. For instance, say you want to figure out if two networks are generated from the same distribution (This means that the matrix that contains edge probabilities, $\\textbf{P}$, is the same for both networks). Then, it's reasonable to assume that their latent positions will be pretty close to each other. Look at the equation below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\min_{W} ||{\\hat{N_1} - \\hat{N_2}W}||_F$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- $W$ is a matrix that just rotates or flips (called an isometry, or an orthonormal matrix)\n",
    "- $\\hat{N_1}$ and $\\hat{N_2}$ are the estimated latent positions for networks one and two, respectively\n",
    "\n",
    "the $||X||_F$ syntax means that we're taking the frobenius norm of $X$. Taking the frobenius norm of a matrix is the same as unwrapping the matrix into a giant vector and measuring that vector's length. So, this equation is saying that the latent position for a given node in network one should be close to the latent position in network two.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, there's that $W$ there, the rotation matrix. We actually wish we didn't have to find it. We have to because of the same problem we keep running into: you can rotate latent positions and they'll still have the same dot product relative to each other, and so you can only embed a network up to a rotation. In practice, you can find this matrix and rotate latent positions for separate networks using it to compare them directly, but again, it's annoying, adds compute power that you probably don't want to use, and it'll add noise to any kind of inference you want to do later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Omnibus Embedding is fundamentally a solution to this problem. Because the embeddings for all of your networks live in the same space, you don't have to rotate them manually -- and you cut out the noise that gets created when you have to *infer* a good rotation matrix. We'll explore all the downstream use cases in future chapters, but below is a sneak peak. \n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below (adapted from Gopalakrishnan et al. 2021 {cite}`mcc`,  is the omnibus embedding for 32 networks created from a bunch of mouse brains, some of which have been genetically modified. The nodes of these networks represent the regions of a mouse brain and the edges represent how well-connected the neurons in a given pair of regions are. The figure below actually only shows two nodes: the node representing one region in the left hemisphere, and the node representing its corresponding region in the right hemisphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what we're actually *plotting* in this embedding is a bit different than normal, because rather than being nodes, the points we plot are *networks*: one for each of our thirty-two mice. The only reason we're able to get away with doing this is the omnibus embedding: each network lives in the same space!"
