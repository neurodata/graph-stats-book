    "Throughout Chapter 5, we spent a lot of attention developing intuition for many of the network models that are essential to understanding random networks. Recall that the notation that we use for a random network (more specifically, a network-valued random variable), $\\mathbf A$, does *not* refer to any network we could ever hope to see (or as we introduced in the previous chapter, *realize*) in the real world. This issue is extremely important in network machine learning, so we will try to drive it home one more time: no matter how much data we collected (unless we could get infinite data, which we *can't*), we can never hope to understand the true distribution of $\\mathbf A$. As network scientists, this leaves us with a bit of a problem: what, then, can we do to make useful claims about $\\mathbf A$, if we can't actually see $\\mathbf A$ nor its distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where statistics, particularly, **estimation**, comes into play. At a very high level, estimation is a procedure to calculate properties about a random variable (or a set of random variables) using *only* the data we are given: finitely many (in network statistics, often just *one*) samples which we assume are *realizations* of the random variable we want to learn about. The properties of the random variable that we seek to learn about are called **estimands**, and  In the case of our network models, in particular, we will attempt to obtain reasonable estimates of the parameters (our *estimands*) associated with random networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several key assumptions will be heavily used throughout the course of this chapter, which were developed in Chapter 5. In particular, the most common two properties we will leverage are:\n",
    "1. Independence of edges: when working with independent-edge random network models, we will assume that edges in our random network are *independent*. This means that the probability of observing a particular realization of a random network is, in fact, the product of the probabilities of observing each edge in the random network. Notationally, what this means is that if $\\mathbf A$ is a random network with $n$ nodes and edges $\\mathbf a_{ij}$, and $A$ is a realization of that random network with edges $a_{ij}$, then:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\mathbb P_\\theta(\\mathbf A = A) &= \\mathbb P(\\mathbf a_{11} = a_{11}, \\mathbf a_{12} = a_{12}, ..., \\mathbf a_{nn} = a_{nn}) \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\prod_{i, j} \\mathbb P_\\theta(\\mathbf a_{ij} = a_{ij})\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "In the special case where our networks are simple (undirected and loopless), this simplifies to:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\mathbb P_\\theta(\\mathbf A = A) &= \\prod_{i < j} \\mathbb P_\\theta(\\mathbf a_{ij} = a_{ij})\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "for any network realization $A$ which is simple. This is because if $\\mathbf a_{ij} = a$, then we also know that $\\mathbf a_{ji} = a$, and we only need to worry about one of the edges (we chose the edges in the upper right triangle of the adjacency matrix arbitrarily).  Further, since $A$ is also simple, then we know hat $\\mathbf a_{ii} = 0$; that is, no nodes have loops, so we don't need to worry about the case where $i = j$ either.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Coin Flip Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about what exactly this means using an example that you are likely familiar with. I have a single coin, and I want to know the probability of the outcome of a roll of that coin being a heads. For sake of argument, we will call this coin *fair*, which means that the true probability it lands on heads (or tails) is $0.5$. In this case, I would call the outcome of the $i^{th}$ coin flip the random variable $\\mathbf x_i$, and it can produce realizations which take one of two possible values: a heads (an outcome of a $1$) or a tails (an outcome of a $0$). We will say that we see $10$ total coin flips. We will number these realizations as $x_i$, where $i$ goes from $1$ to $10$. To recap, the boldfaced $\\mathbf x_i$ denotes the random variable, and the unbolded $x_i$ denotes the realization which we actually see. Our question of interest is: how do we estimate the probability of the coin landing on a heads, if we don't know anything about the true probability value $p$, other than the outcomes of the coin flips we got to observe?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, since $\\mathbf x_i$ takes the value $1$ or $0$ each with probability $0.5$, we would say that $\\mathbf x_i$ is a $Bernoulli(0.5)$ random variable. This means that the random variable $\\mathbf x$ has the Bernoulli distribution, and the probability of a heads, $p$, is $0.5$. All $10$ of our $\\mathbf x_i$ are called *identically distributed*, since they all have the same $Bernoulli(0.5)$ distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also assume that the outcomes of the coin flips are mutually independent, which is explained in the terminology section.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any one coin flip, the probability of observing the outcome $i$ is, by definition of the Bernoulli distribution:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\mathbb P_\\theta(\\mathbf x_i = x_i) = p^{x_i} (1 - p)^{1 - x_i}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Note that we use the notation $\\mathbb P_\\theta$ to indicate that the probability is a function of the parameter set $\\theta$ for the random variable $\\mathbf x_i$. Here, since the only parameter for each $\\mathbf x_i$ is a probability $p$, then $\\theta = p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we saw $n$ total outcomes, the probability is, using the definition of mutual independence:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\mathbb P_\\theta(\\mathbf x_1 = x_1, ..., \\mathbf x_{n} = x_{n}; p) &= \\prod_{i = 1}^{n}\\mathbb P(\\mathbf x_i = x_i) \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\prod_{i = 1}^n p^{x_i}(1 - p)^{1 - x_i} \\\\\n",
    "    &= p^{\\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i}(1 - p)^{n - \\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "What if we saw $10$ coin flips, and $6$ were heads? Can we take a \"guess\" at what $p$ might be? Intuitively your first reaction might be to say a good guess of $p$, which we will abbreviate $\\hat p$, would be $0.6$, which is $6$ heads of $10$ outcomes. In many ways, this intuitive guess is spot on. However, in network machine learning, we like to be really specific about why, exactly, this guess makes sense. \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the above equation, one thing we can do is use the technique of **maximum likelihood estimation**. We call the function $\\mathbb P(\\mathbf x_1 = x_1, ..., \\mathbf x_n = x_n; p)$ the *likelihood* of our sequence, for a given value of $p$. Note that we have added the term \"$; p$\" to our notation, which is simply to emphasize the dependence of the likelihood on the probability. So, what we *really* want to do is find the value that $p$ could take, which *maximizes* the likelihood. Let's see what the likelihood function looks like as a function of different values of $p$:"

In a pairs plot, we investigate how effectively the embedding \"separates\" nodes within the dataset into individual \"clusters\". We will ultimately exploit these \"clusters\" that appear in the latent positions to generate community assignments for each node.
