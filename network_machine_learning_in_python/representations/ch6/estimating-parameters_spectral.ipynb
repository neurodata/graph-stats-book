    "In order to produce an estimate of $X$, we also need to know the number of latent dimensions of $\\pmb A$, $d$. We might have a reasonable ability to \"guess\" what $d$ is ahead of time, but this will often not be the case. For this reason, we can instead estimate $d$ using $\\hat d$ [cite ZG2]. $\\hat d$ represents an estimate of $d$, which is selected on the basis of \"elbow picking\", as described in the section on spectral embedding. The $\\hat \\cdot$ symbol just means that $\\hat d$ is an estimate of the number of latent dimensions $d$, and not necessarily the *actual* number of latent dimensions. The estimate of $X$ is produced by using the [Adjacency Spectral Embedding](link?), by embedding the observed network $A$ into $d$ (if the number of latent dimensions is known) or $\\hat d$ (if the number of latent dimensions is not known) dimensions.\n",

The nodes of our network represent the people who live along our assumed street. If two people are closer to one another, it might make sense to think that they have a higher probability of being friends. If two people are neighbors, we think that they will have a very high probability of being friends (almost $1$) and when people are very far apart, we think that they will have a very low probability of being friends (almost $0$).

    "When embedding a matrix using any embedding techniques of `graspologic`, it is critical to investigate the quality of an embedding. One technique to do so that is particularly useful for uncovering \"latent structure\" (community assignments which are present, but *unknown* by us ahead of time) from a graph we suspect might be well-fit by a Stochastic Block Model is known as a \"pairs plot\". In a pairs plot, we investigate how effectively the embedding \"separates\" nodes within the dataset into individual \"clusters\". We will ultimately exploit these \"clusters\" that appear in the latent positions to generate community assignments for each node. To demonstrate the case where the \"pairs plot\" shows obvious latent community structure, we will use the predicted latent position matrix we just produced, from an adjacency matrix which is a realization of a random network which is truly a Stochastic Block Model.

Stated another way, the off-diagonal plot is a scatter plot for each node of the $k^{th}$ dimension and the $l^{th}$ dimension of the latent position matrix.
