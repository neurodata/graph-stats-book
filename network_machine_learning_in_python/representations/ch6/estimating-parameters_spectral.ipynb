    "Now, you will notice a very interesting property about the latent position matrix for an SBM. Remember that for an RDPG (and an SBM is also an RDPG), the latent position vectors for the node $i$ are the *rows* $\\vec x_i$ of the latent position matrix $X$. This means that the latent position vector for node $1$ is the vector $(\\sqrt{\\sigma_1}u_{11}, \\sqrt{\\sigma_2}u_{21})$. What do you notice about the latent positions vector for node $2$? It's *exactly* the same! \n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, the latent position vector for *all* nodes which are in the same community will be identical. This is why if you look across the latent position matrix $X$ above, there are only two unique latent position vectors: there are one unique vector (which is black in the first dimension and red in the second dimension) for the nodes in the first community, and a second unique vector (which is black in the first dimension and beige in the second dimension) for the nodes of the second community.\n",

    "5. We can express the matrix $P$ using the latent position matrix $X$, which is the product of the first $K$ singular vectors with the first $K$ singular values.\n",
    "This means that you have found a latent position matrix $X$ for the probability matrix using the singular values and singular vectors of $P$, by effectively just discarding the ones that don't matter (and have singular values of $0$). We have succeeded in our goal of finding a much lower rank structure, the latent position matrix $X$, to describe the probability matrix $P$.\n",

    "\n",
    "All of the logic you developed above was with respect to the probability matrix, $P$, for a SBM. More generally, this logic extends to the probability matrix $P$ for any RDPG, which is because an RDPG with $d$ latent dimensions will *always* have a probability matrix that is *exactly* rank $d$. If you took the latent position matrix $X$ which had $d$ latent dimensions, and then used the svd to find the $U_d$ and $\\Sigma_d$ where $P = U_d \\Sigma_d U_d^\\top$, you could find another latent position matrix $Y = U_d\\sqrt{\\Sigma_d}$ where $P = YY^\\top$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, you have a slight issue: when you perform machine learning, you don't know the probability matrix! The probability matrix is a *parameter* of the statistical model itself, it is *not* a function of the sample of data you get. All you have is the adjacency matrix itself, $A$, which is your data! We don't actually know what the underlying probability matrix is! How the heck can you find this low rank structure you want to be able to estimate?\n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out, if you kept obtaining more and more networks $A$ from the underlying RDPG random network $\\mathbf A$, you would *expect* that the network $A$ you saw would be the probability matrix $P$. We'll explain what you mean by expect here by turning back to your coin flip example. As you remember, you perform a coin flip at each pair of nodes $i$ and $j$ of an RDPG, where the coin lands on heads with probability $\\vec x_i\\vec x_j^\\top$, and lands on tails with probability $1 - \\vec x_i\\vec x_j^\\top$. This means you can *expect* the coin to land on heads with probability $\\vec x_i\\vec x_j^\\top$. In the same sense, you can expect the $(i,j)$ entry of the adjacency matrix $A$ to exist with probability $\\vec x_i \\vec x_j^\\top$. In this sense, the expected value of the adjacency matrix $A$ *is* the probability matrix $P = XX^\\top$. \n",

For this reason, it is usually a good idea when you think a network might be well described by an RDPG to let the elbow selection algorithm do the work for us, and then take a good look at the scree plot to make sure the number of latent dimensions chosen seems reasonable to us.

    "As it turns out, this example here is a good instance of another property of the latent position matrix. Remember that the latent position matrix is the matrix $X$ where $P = XX^\\top$. As it turns out, sometimes the columns of this matrix can get flipped around a little bit, through something called a rotation. You can see this by noticing that it looks a lot like the entries of the estimates of the latent position matrix are positive in one case are negative for the other, and it basically looks like the colorbar just got flipped around on us. The rotation doesn't really matter (yet!), and $P$ still is equal to $XX^\\top$, regardless of how that $X$ is rotated. We'll learn more about rotation matrices in the upcoming section on [Multiple Network Representation Learning](#link?) and in the section on [Two Sample Hypothesis Testing](#link?), but for now, all you need to know is that this \"flippage\" of what's big and small in the latent position matrix is not too important (again, yet!)."

    "Well, it turns out that LSE and ASE capture different notions of \"structure\" when embedding a network. Carey Priebe and collaborators at Johns Hopkins University investigated this recently, in 2018, and discovered that LSE tends to capture \"affinity\" structure, whereas ASE tends to capture \"core-periphery\" structure (their paper is called \"On a two-truths phenomenon in spectral graph clustering\" - it's an interesting read for the curious). What do these words mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a sentence, affinity structure is a property under which there exist communities of nodes in the network, and those nodes tend to be more heavily connected within-community than between-community (nodes in the same community have more *affinity* for one another, also known as *homophily*). Think of a friend network in two schools, where people within the same school are much more likely to be friends than people in different schools. This is a type of structure we've seen a lot in this book in your Stochastic Block Model examples.\n",

    "On the other hand, a core-periphery structure is a property under which there exists a subset of nodes in the network which have much higher degrees than other nodes in the network (the *core* of the network, since most of the edges are found in the *core* nodes), and there are other subsets of nodes which tend to have much lower degrees than other nodes in the network (the *periphery* of the network, since these nodes tend to take a secondary position edge wise to the *core* nodes). Think of a core of popular, well-liked, and charismatic kids at a high school, with a periphery of loners or people who prefer not to socialize as much.\n",
