    "# Estimating Parameters in Network Models via Spectral Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the ability to estimate parameters via MLE for the SBM, you might think we are done discussing SBM estimation. Unfortunately, we have skipped a relatively fundamental problem with SBM parameter estimation. You will notice that everything we have covered about the SBM to date assumes that we the assignments to one of $K$ possible communities for each node, which is given by the node assignment variable $\\tau_i$ for each node in the network. Why is this problematic? Well, quite simply, when we are learning about *many* different networks we might come across, we might not actually *observe* the communities of each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider, for instance, the school example we have worked extensively with. In the context of the SBM, for each pair of individuals across one of two schools, we think that if two individuals go to the same school, they will have a higher probability of being friends than if they did not go to the same school. And therein lies the issue: we need to know ahead of time (in statistical speak, *a priori*, or *prior to* proceeding) which school each student is from. If we did not know which school each student was from, we would have *no way* of actually using the technique we described in the preceding chapter to estimate parameters for our SBM. So, what *can* we do?\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the way we will proceed is to devise a technique for estimation for RDPGs, and then we will use this technique for RDPG estimation to produce meaningful community assignments for our nodes. Effectively, what we will do is we will use a clever technique we discussed in the preceding sections, called an *embedding*, to learn not only about each edge, but to *learn about each node in relation to all of the other nodes*. What do we mean by this? What we mean is that, while looking at a single edge in our network, we only have two possible choices: the edge exists or it does not exist. However, if we instead consider nodes in *relation* to one another, we can start to deduce patterns about how our nodes might be organized in the community sense. While seeing that two students Bill and Stephanie were friends will not tell us whether Bill and Stephanie were in the same school, if we knew that Bill and Stephanie also shared many other friends (such as Denise, Albert, and Kwan), and those friends also tended to be friends, that piece of information might tell us that they all might happen to be school mates. \n",
    "\n",
    "The embedding technique we employ, the *spectral embedding*, allows us to pick up on these *clustered* sorts of tendencies. When we call a set of nodes a **cluster** in the context of a network, what we mean is that these nodes tend to be more connected (more edges exist between and amongst them) than with other nodes in the network. The spectral embeddings will help us to identify these clusters of nodes, and hopefully, when we review the clusters of nodes we learn, we will be able to derive some sort of insight. For instance, in our school example, ideally, we might pick up on two clusters of nodes, one for each school. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Random Dot Product Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Dot Product Graph has a single parameter, the latent position matrix $X$. Remember that the latent position matrix has $n$ rows, one for each node in the network, and $d$ columns, one for each latent dimension in the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that when we see a network which we think might be a realization of an RDPG random network, we do not actually have the latent position matrix $X$ ahead of time. For this reason, we must *estimate* $X$. Unfortunately, we cannot just use MLE like we did for the ER and SBM networks. Instead, we will use spectral methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to produce an estimate of $X$, we also need to know the number of latent dimensions of $\\pmb A$, $d$. We might have a reasonable ability to \"guess\" what $d$ is ahead of time, but this will often not be the case. For this reason, we can instead estimate $d$ using the strategy described in [6.3.7](link?). Once we have an adjacency matrix $A$ and a number of latent dimensions $d$ (or an estimate of the number of latent dimensions, which we will call $\\hat d$), producing an estimate of the latent position matrix is very straightforward. We simply use the adjacency spectral embedding to embed the adjacency matrix $A$ into $d$ (or, $\\hat d$) dimensions. The resulting embedded adjacency matrix *is* the estimate of the latent position matrix. We will call the estimate of the latent position matrix $\\hat X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try an example of an *a priori* RDPG. We will use the same example that we used in the single network models section, where we defined the latent position matrix $X$ as follows. Let's assume that we have $60$ people who live along a very long road that is $60$ miles long, and each person is $1$ of a mile apart. The nodes of our network represent the people who live along the street. If two people are close to one another, it might make sense to guess that they have a higher chance of being friends. If two people are neighbors, we think that they will have a very high probability of being friends (almost $1$) and when people are very far apart, we think that they will have a very low probability of being friends (almost $0$). We define $X$ to have rows given by:\n",

    "    \\vec x_i = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "        \\left(\\frac{60 - i}{60}\\right)^2 \\\\\n",
    "        \\left(\\frac{i}{60}\\right)^2\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "In this case, since each $\\vec x_i$ is $2$-dimensional, the number of latent dimensions in $X$ is $d=2$. Let's simulate an example network:"

One particularly useful way to figure out this \"latent structure\" (community assignments which are present, but *unknown* by us ahead of time) from a graph we suspect might be well-fit by a Stochastic Block Model is known as a \"pairs plot\". In a pairs plot, we investigate how effectively the embedding \"separates\" nodes within the dataset into individual \"clusters\". We will ultimately exploit these \"clusters\" that appear in the latent positions to generate community assignments for each node. To demonstrate the case where the \"pairs plot\" shows obvious latent community structure, we will use the predicted latent position matrix we just produced, from an adjacency matrix which is a realization of a random network which is truly a Stochastic Block Model.

Stated another way, the off-diagonal plot is a scatter plot for each node of the $k^{th}$ dimension and the $l^{th}$ dimension of the latent position matrix.
