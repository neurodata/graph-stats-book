    "We have a range of possible weights to search through, but we don't have the best one. To find it, we'll embed with Covariate-Assisted Clustering, using all the tricks described previously, for as many alpha-values in our range as we're willing to test. Then, we'll simply pick the value which best lets us distinguish between the different communities in our network. \n",
    "\n",
    "To figure out which $\\alpha$ is best, we need to cluster our data using a machine learning algorithm. The algorithm of choice will be scikit-learn's faster implementation of k-means. K-means is a simple algorithm capable of clustering most datasets very quickly and efficiently, often in only a few iterations. It works by initially sticking some number of predetermined cluster centers in essentially random places in our data, and then iterating through a searching procedure until all the cluster centers are in nice places. If you want more information, you can check out the original paper by Stuart Lloyd<sup>2</sup>, or scikit-learn's tutorial describing K-means<sup>3</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to define exactly what it means to check which values produce the best clustering. Fortunately, K-means comes out-of-the-box with a fine definition: its objective function, the sum of squared distances of each point from its cluster center. In KMeans, this is called the \"inertia\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is Python code which searches through our range of possible $\\alpha$ values, and then tests a clustering using each value. Because it's quicker, we'll only look through ten values, but in principle the more values you test the better (and the slower)."
