    "In practice, many networks you will encounter in network machine learning will *not* be simple networks. As we discussed in the preceding discussion, many of the techniques we discuss will be just fine to use with weighted networks. Unfortunately, real world networks are often extremely noisy, and so the analysis of one real world network might not generalize very well to a similar real world network. For this reason, we turn to *regularization*. \n",

    "In network machine learning, the first step is to typically modify the network (or networks) themselves to allow better generalization of your statistical inference to new datasets. Later chapters, such as {ref}`ch6` and many areas of the Applications, will cover approaches in which you modify the function you are estimating.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the following subsections, we'll pose an example, a simulation, and code for how to implement the desired regularization approach. It is important to realize that you might use several of these techniques simultaneously in practice, or you might have a reason to use these techniques that go outside of our working examples.\n",

    "To start this section off, we're going to introduce an example that's going to be fundamental in many future sections you see in this book. You have a group of $50$ local students who attend a school in your area. The first $25$ of the students polled are athletes, and the second $25$ of the students polled are in marching band. You want to analyze how good of friends the students are, and to do so, you will use network machine learning. The nodes of the network will be the students. Next, we will describe how the two networks are collected:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Activity/Hobby Network: To collect the first network, you ask each student to select from a list of $50$ school activities and outside hobbies that they enjoy. For a pair of students $i$ and $j$, the weight of their interest alignment will be a score between $0$ and $50$ indicating how many activities or hobbies that they have in common. We will refer to this network as the activity/hobby network. This network is obviously undirected, since if student $i$ shares $x$ activities or hobbies with student $j$, then student $j$ also shares $x$ activities or hobbies with student $i$. This network is weighted, since the score is between $0$ and $50$. Finally, this network is loopless, because it would not make sense to look at the activity/hobby alignment of a student with themself, since this number would be largely uninformative as every student would have perfect alignment of activities and hobbies with him or herself. \n",
    "2. Friendship Network: To collect the second network, you ask each student to rate how good of friends they are with other students, on a scale from $0$ to $1$. A score of $0$ means they are not friends with the student or do not know the student, and a score of $1$ means the student is their best friend. We will refer to this network as the friendship network. This network is clearly directed, since two students may differ on their understanding of how good of friends they are. This network is weighted, since the score is between $0$ and $1$. Finally, this network is also loopless, because it would not make sense to ask somebody how good of friends they are with themself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our scientific question of interest is how well activities and hobbies align with perceived notions of friendship. You want to use the preceding networks to learn about a hypothetical third network, a network whose nodes are identical to the two networks above, but whose edges are whether the two individuals are friends (or not) on facebook. To answer this question, you have quite the job to do to make your networks better suited to the task! You begin by simulating some example data, shown below as adjacency matrix heatmaps:"

The activity/hobby network is *undirected*, which means that if a student $i$ is friends on facebook with student $j$, then student $j$ is also friends with student $i$. On the other hand, as you learned above, the friendship network was directed. Since your question of interest is about an undirected network but the network you have is directed, it might be useful if you could take the directed friendship network and learn an undirected network from it. This relates directly to the concept of *interpretability*, in that you need to represent your friendship network in a form that will produce an answer for us about your facebook network which you can understand.\n",

Then, you will construct a new adjacency matrix $A'$, where each entry $a_{ij}'$ *and* $a_{ji}'$ are set equal to $w_{ij}$.  The little apostrophe just signifies that this is a potentially different value than either $a_{ij}$ or $a_{ji}$.

    "In your future works with network machine learning, you will come across numerous techniques which operate on adjacency matrices which are *positive semi-definite*. This word doesn't mean a whole lot to us for network machine learning, but it has a big implication when you try to use algorithms on many of your networks. Remember that when you have a loopless network, a common practice in network science is to set the diagonal to zero. What this does is it leads to your adjacency matrices being *indefinite* (which means, *not* positive semi-definite). For us, this means that many network machine learning techniques simply cannot operate on these adjacency matrices. However, as we mentioned before, these entries are not actually zero, but simply *do not exist* and you just didn't have a better way to represent them. Or do we?\n",

    "\n",
    "As you are probably aware, in all of machine learning, you are always concerned with the *bias/variance tradeoff*. The [**bias/variance tradeoff**](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/printings/ESLII_print11.pdf) is an unfortunate side-effect that concerns how well a learning technique will generalize to new datasets. \n",
    "1. **Bias** is an error from erroneous assumptions you make about the system that you are learning about. For instance, if you have a friendship network, you might make simplifying assumptions, such as an assumption that two athletes frorm different sports have an equally likely chance of being friends with a member of the band. This might be flat out false, as band members might be selectively better friends with athletes depending on which sports they play.\n",
    "2. On the other hand, the **variance** is the degree to which the an estimate of a task will change when given new data. An assumption that if a player is a football player he has a higher chance of being friends with a band member might make sense given that the band performs at football games. \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"trade-off\" is that these two factors tend to be somewhat at odds, in that raising the bias tends to lower the variance, and vice-versa:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High bias, but low variance**: Whereas a lower variance model might be better suited to the situation where the data you expect to see is noisy, it might not as faithfully represent the underlying dynamics you think the network possesses. A low variance model might ignore that athletes might have a different chance of being friends with a band member based on their sport all together. This means that while you won't get the student relationships *correct*, you might still be able to get a reasonable estimate that you think is not due to overfitting. In this case, you've smoothed away *signal* from the data at the expense of avoiding *noise*.\n",
    "2. **Low bias, but high variance**: Whereas a low bias model might more faithfully model true relationships in your training data, it might fit your training data a little *too* well. Fitting the training data too well is a problem known as **overfitting**. If you only had three football team members and tried to assume that football players were better friends with band members, you might not be able to well approximate this relationship because of how few individuals you have who reflect this situation. \n",

    "#### Sparsification of the network\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure of **sparsification** is one in which we take a network, and we remove edges from it. Remember that removing edges, in terms of the adjacency matrix, is analogous to setting the corresponding adjacencies to zero. A matrix with many entries of zero is called a *sparse* matrix. So, the reason we call the removal of the edges from a network *sparsification* is that we are producing a network with a *sparse* adjacency matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Sparsification* is a general class of edge regularization techniques, and includes many flavors. Here, we discuss a few of them. In network sparsification, we will often pick some property of the network (such as, a particular edge weight) and remove edges in an attempt to preserve something about this particular property.\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful tool to study for how, exactly, you might want to go about sparsifying the network is called the *edge-weight distribution* of your network sample. The edge-weight distribution of the network sample are the particular values that the edge weights of the network take. The most common way to visualize the edge-weight distribution is an edge-weight histogram. This is very similar to the node-degree histogram you worked with above, but instead of node degrees, you look at the edge-weights. Let's take a look at the friendship network, and then take a look at its edge-weight distribution. Remember that the friendship network is *undirected*, so we need to remove its diagonal elements *before* we visualize the edge-weight distribution. We'll also remove edges with zero-weights for visualization purposes:"

    "##### Truncation removes the smallest edges\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to reduce the variance due to edge weight noise is called *edge truncation*. **Edge truncation** is a process by which you choose some threshold value $\\tau$, and remove all of the weights which are smaller than $\\tau$ but retain the weights that are bigger than $\\tau$. For edges that are equal to $\\tau$, what you'll want to do depends on the strategy you are employing.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how is $\\tau$ typically chosen? There are a few ways, but it's usually one of the below two:\n",
    "1. Choose $\\tau$ arbitrarily: after looking at your network and doing some preliminary visualizations, you might determine that your edge weights tend to be \"multi-modal\". This means that when you look at the edge-weight distribution, you see multiple \"clusters\" of edge weight bins which are larger, or smaller. For a lot of networks, these small edges might be very noise induced; that is, the small edges might just spuriously be close to, but *not quite*, zero, due to errors in your measuring process. When the edge weights are really tiny, you might think that these noisy edges are better off just not existing.\n",
    "2. Choose $\\tau$ based on a particular quantile: A quantile is a percentile divided by $100$. In this strategy, you identify a target quantile of the edge-weight distribution. What this means is that you are selecting the lowest *fraction* of the edge-weights (where that fraction is the quantile that you choose) and setting these edges to $0$, and selecting the remaining edges are left unchanged. If you select a quantile of $0.5$, this means that you take the smallest $50\\%$ of edges and set them to zero, and the largest $50\\%$ of edges and retain their initial value.\n",
    "This is called *truncation* because you are taking the edge-weight distribution, and *truncating* (cutting it off) below the value $\\tau$. Let's see how this works in practice. \n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to what to do with edges that are equal to $\\tau$, when you choose a threshold arbitrarily, you can do whatever you want with them, as long as you are consistent if you have multiple networks you are truncating. What we mean by this is that you can select to remove edges less than or equal to this threshold, or retain edge weights greater than or equal to the threshold. When you truncate on the basis of a quantile, however, this is not quite the case. You will want to remove all the edges below $\\tau$, and truncate away the remaining edges equal to $\\tau$ at random until you have truncated the desired fraction of edges in total.\n",

Imagine, for instance, that you have a network in which $50\\%$ of the possible edges do not exist and have an adjacency entry of $0$, and $50\\%$ of the possible edges exist and have an adjacency entry of $1$ (the network density is $0.5$). If you threshold this network at the $0.3$ quantile, you will have a cutoff of $0$, and if you *don't* handle ties appropriately, the network will remain identical before and after thresholding. This means that while you would expect the network density to be $1 - 0.3 = 0.7$, you would still have a network with a density of $0.5$.

If the edge-weights take continuous values, that means that the probability of any two edge-weights being identical is exactly zero, so ties will not be possible!

Notice that the edge-weights for your friendship network takes values between $0$ and $1$, but your activity network takes values between $0$ and almost $15$. How can you possibly compare between these two networks where the edge-weights take such different ranges of values? You turn to standardization, which allows us to place values from different networks on the same scale. \n",

    "The first approach to edge-weight standardization is known commonly as $z$-scoring. Suppose that $A$ is the adjacency matrix, with entries $a_{ij}$. With a $z$-score, you will rescale the weights of the adjacency matrix, such that the new edge-weights (called $z$-scores) are approximately normally distributed. The reason this can be useful is that the normal distribution is pretty ubiquitous across many branches of science, and therefore, a $z$-score is relatively easy to communicate with other scientists. Further, many things that exist in nature can be well-approximated by a normal distribution, so it seems like a reasonable place to start to use a $z$-score for edge-weights, too! The $z$-score is defined as follows. You will construct the $z$-scored adjacency matrix $Z$, whose entries $z_{ij}$ are the corresponding $z$-scores of the adjacency matrix's entries $a_{ij}$. For a weighted, loopless network, you use an estimate of the *mean*, $\\hat \\mu$, and the *unbiased* estimate of the *variance*, $\\hat \\sigma^2$), which can be computed as follows:\n",

An ordinal relationship just means that you have a natural ordering to the edge-weights. This means that you can identify a largest edge-weight, a smallest edge-weight, and every position in between. When you want to preserve ordinal relationships in your network, you do something called *passing the non-zero edge-weights to ranks*. We will often use the abbreviation `ptr` to define this function because it is so useful for weighted networks. You pass non-zero edge-weights to ranks as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify all of the non-zero entries of the adjacency matrix $A$.\n",
    "2. Count the number of non-zero entries of the adjacency matrix $A$, $n_{nz}$.\n",
    "3. Rank all of the non-zero edges in the adjacency matrix $A$, where for a non-zero entry $a_{ij}$, $rank(a_{ij}) = 1$ if $a_{ij}$ is the smallest non-zero edge-weight, and $rank(a_{ij}) = n_{nz}$ if $a_{ij}$ is the largest edge-weight. Ties are settled by using the average rank of the two entries.\n",
    "3. Report the weight of each non-zero entry $(i,j)$ as $r_{ij} = \\frac{rank(a_{ij})}{n_{nz} + 1}$, and for eachh zero entry as $r_{ij} = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you pass-to-ranks the directed friendship network using `graspologic`, showing both the adjacency matrix and the edge-weight distribution before and after `ptr`:"

For instance, if you picked a threshold of $0.5$, there is some corresponding rank (or value in between two ranks), where all of the elements of the adjacency matrix with a rank lower than a given threshold $\\tau_r$ have corresponding weights lower than $\\tau$ and all of the elements of the adjacency matrix with a rank higher than a given threshold $\\tau_r$ have corresponding weights higher than $\\tau$.

A calculator will give you that $log_{10}(x) = -3, log_{10}(y) = -1$, and $log_{10}(z) = 1$. Even though $y$ is only $.099$ units bigger than $x$, its logarithm $log_{10}(y)$ exceeds $log_{10}(x)$ by two units. on the other hand, $z$ is $9.9$ units bigger than $y$, but yet its logarithm $log_{10}(z)$ is still the same two units bigger than $log_{10}(y)$. This is because thhe logarithm is instead looking at the fact that $z$ is *one* power of ten, $y$ is $-1$ powers of ten, and $z$ is $-3$ powers of ten. The logarithm has *collapsed* the huge size difference between $z$ and the other two values $x$ and $y$ by using exponentiation with *base* ten. \n",
