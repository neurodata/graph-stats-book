An **edge-weight** $w(i,j)$ assigns a weight to an edge between nodes $i$ and $j$ if that edge exists. If you care about weightedness in the network, the network is called *weighted*. The potential edges $a_{ij}$ of $A$ for a weighted network take the value of the edge-weight; that is, $a_{ij} = w(i, j)$ for any edge which exists between nodes $i$ and $j$. In the below plot, edge-weight indicates the approximate time to travel from one borough to the other. The network is undirected, so you don't have to worry about directionality differences.

    "#### Degrees for directed networks\n",
    "\n",
    "A question you might have in the back of your head is, \"what if the network is directed?\" When the network is directed, you have two types of degrees, the *in degree* and the *out degree*. The **in degree** of a node $i$ in a directed network is the number of nodes which have edges that go *to* node $i$. Remember that the column of the adjacency matrix, $a_{ji}$, where $j$ indexes all of the nodes of the network, take a value of $1$ if node $j$ has a directed edge from itself to node $i$. This means that to compute the in-degree for node $i$, we just need to sum its column of the adjacency matrix:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    degree(i)_{in} &= \\sum_{j = 1}^n a_{ji}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "On the other hand, the **out degree** of a node $i$ is the number of nodes that node $i$ has edges which point to. By the exact same logic, the row of the adjacency matrix $a_{ij}$, where $j$ indexes all of the nodes of the network, takes a value of $1$ if node $i$ has a directed edge from itself to some other node $j$. This means that to compute the out-degree for node $i$, we just need to sum its row of the adjacency matrix:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    degree(i)_{out} &= \\sum_{j = 1}^n a_{ij}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "In an undirected network, since $a_{ji} = a_{ij}$ these quantities are equal, which is how we ended up with the nice relationship in the preceding section. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a directed network, since there is no concept of a *node degree* like there was for an undirected network, we instead have two degree matrices: the *in-degree matrix* $D_{in}$ and the *out-degree matrix* $D_{out}$. The **in-degree matrix** $D_{in}$ is the matrix whose diagonal entries are the in-degrees of each node $i$ in the network. The **out-degree matrix** $D_{out}$ is the matrix whose diagonal entries are the out-degrees of each node $i$ in the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Degrees for weighted networks\n",
    "\n",
    "If the network is weighted, either weighted and directed or weighted and undirected, all of the logic we've learned so far applies directly. Remember that the adjacency matrix $A$ has entries $a_{ij} = w(i, j)$ if the edge exists between nodes $i$ and $j$ and $0$ otherwise. This means that when we compute the degrees (either the undirected node degree, the in-degree, or the out-degree), we instead sum edge weights when the edge exists, and $0$s otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Network summary statistics tell us useful attributes about networks\n",
    "\n",
    "When you learn about networks, it is often valuable to compute properties of the network so that you can get a better understanding of the relationships within it. You will call these properties *network summary statistics*. Although this book will focus more on *learned* representations of networks, summary statistics are a sort of *engineered* representation. You will learn several network summary statistics, and in the next section, we will explore the [limitations of network summary statistics](ch4:net-rep:featurelims).\n",

    "### The network density indicates the fraction of possible edges which exist\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the adjacency matrix $A$ of a simple network, what fraction of the possible edges *actually* exist? \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this quantity, first you need to understand how many edges are possible in a network. You have $n$ total nodes in the network, so $A$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix. Therefore, $A$ has $n^2$ total entries. However, it turns out that over *half* of these entries are redundant for simple networks. Since you are assuming the network is simple, the network is by definition loopless. This means that every entry is *by default* $0$ along the diagonal. Since each node $i$ has a corresponding diagonal entry $a_{ii}$, this comes to $n$ entries that you do not need to count. This leaves your total possible number of edges at $n^2$ (the total number of entries in the matrix $A$) minus $n$ (the total number of entries which are automatically $0$), or $n^2 - n = n(n - 1)$. This quantity represents the total number of possible edges which are *not* in the diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "What else are you overcounting? Well, as it turns out, if the network is also *undirected* (which it is, because it is *simple*), every node that is *not* in the diagonal is also being double counted. Why is this? Remember that an undirected network has an adjacency matrix where for every pair of nodes $i$ and $j$, $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$. This means that you overcount the number of possible edges not in the diagonal by a factor of *two*, since each off-diagonal entry $a_{ij}$ has a corresponding entry $a_{ji}$. This leaves the total number of possible edges in the network as $\\frac{1}{2}n(n - 1)$, or the total number of possible edges not in the diagonal reduced by a factor of two. This quantity is notated by $\\binom n 2$, which is read as \"$n$ *choose* $2$\". You might see this notation arise in the study of *combinatorics*, where it is used to answer the question of, \"In how many ways can you *choose* two items from $n$ items?\" In the network below, you see all of the *possible* edges indicated in red. If you count them up, there are $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 5 \\cdot (5 - 1) = 10$ possible edges:"

The triplets are *closed* if there are three edges, and *open* if there are only two edges. For instance, in the above network, you have the following triplets of nodes:\n",

Note that if a triplet between nodes $i$, $j$, and $k$ is closed, then all three of the potential edges $a_{ij}$, $a_{jk}$, and $a_{ki}$ have a value of $1$. Therefore, if you could the number of times that $a_{ij}a_{jk}a_{ki} = 1$, you also count the number of closed triplets! This means that the number of closed triplets can be expressed as $\\sum_{i,j,k}a_{ij}a_{jk}a_{ki}$. \n",

Therefore, the tuple of nodes $(i, j, k)$ is a triplet, because *at least* two edges exist amongst the three nodes. This tuple is closed if the edge $(j, k)$ exists, and open if the edge $(j, k)$ does not exist.\n",
