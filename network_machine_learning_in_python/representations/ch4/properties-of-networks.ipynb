An **edge-weight** $w(i,j)$ assigns a weight to an edge between nodes $i$ and $j$ if that edge exists. If we care about weightedness in the network, the network is called *weighted*. The adjacencies $a_{ij}$ of $A$ for a weighted network take the value of the edge-weight; that is, $a_{ij} = w_{ij}$ for any edge which exists between nodes $i$ and $j$. In the below plot, edge-weight indicates the approximate time to travel from one borough to the other. The network will be undirected, so we don't have to worry about directionality differences:\n",

In terms of the adjacency matrix, two nodes $i$ and $j$ are adjacent if the adjacency $a_{ij}$ takes the value a value of one. For instance, in the New York City example, the nodes SI and BK are adjacent due to the presence of the green edge, shown in the figure. A related property is known as *incidence*. A node $i$ is incident an edge $(i, j)$ or an edge $(j,i)$ if the node $i$ is one of the two nodes which the edge connects. The adjacencies corresponding to this edge, $a_{ij}$ and $a_{ji}$, will both take a value of one.

For instance, if we consider the node BK in our example, we have three incident edges, indicated in green, so $degree(v_{BK}) = 3$.

Since we said that the network was loopless, this means that every entry is *by default* $0$ along the diagonal. Since each node $i$ has a corresponding diagonal entry $a_{ii}$, this comes to $n$ entries in total that we do not need to count. This leaves our total possible number of edges at $n^2$ (the total number of entries in the matrix $A$) minus $n$ (the total number of entries which are automatically $0$), or $n^2 - n = n(n - 1)$. This quantity represents the total number of possible edges which are *not* in the diagonal.\n",

    "What else are we overcounting? Well, as it turns out, since the network is also *undirected*, this means that every node that is *not* in the diagonal is also being double counted. Why is this? Remember that a network which is undirected has an adjacency matrix where for every pair of nodes $i$ and $j$, $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$. This means that we overcount the number of possible edges not in the diagonal by a factor of *two*, since all off-diagonal entries $a_{ij}$ have a corresponding pair $a_{ji}$. This leaves the total number of possible edges in the network as $\\frac{1}{2}n(n - 1)$, or the total number of possible edges not in the diagonal reduced by a factor of two. This quantity is equivalent to the notation $\\binom n 2$, which is read as \"$n$ *choose* $2$\". You might see this notation arise in the study of *combinatorics*, where it is used to answer the question of, \"In how many ways can we *choose* two items from $n$ items?\" In the network below, we see all of the *possible* edges indicated in red. If you count them up, there are $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 5 \\cdot (5 - 1) = 10$ red edges, in total:"

    "Now, how many edges *actually* exist in our network? The sum of all of the entries of $A$ can be represented by the quantity $\\sum_{i = 1}^n \\sum_{i = 1}^n a_{ij}$, however, again there are some redundancies when considering the total edge-count of $A$. Remember that $A$ is loopless, so we don't need to count the diagonal entries at all. This brings our quantity to $\\sum_{i = 1}^n \\sum_{i \\neq j}a_{ij}$, since we don't need to count any edges along the diagonal of $A$. Next, remember that if an edge in $A$ exists between nodes $i$ and $j$, that *both* $a_{ij}$ and $a_{ji}$ take the value of $1$, due to the undirected property. This means that to obtain the edge count of $A$, that we only need to count *either* $a_{ij}$ *or* $a_{ji}$. Somewhat arbitrarily in this book, we will always count the adjacencies $a_{ij}$ in the upper triangle of $A$, which are the entries where $j > i$. This brings our quantity to $\\sum_{i = 1}^n \\sum_{j > i} a_{ij}$, which we can write $\\sum_{j > i}a_{ij}$ for short.

A triplet is *closed* if there are three edges, and is open if there are only two edges. In our example, there is one closed triplet {BK, MH, Q}, and there are two open triplets {SI, MH, BK} and {SI, BK, Q}. The global clustering coefficient is defined as:\n",

Note that if a triplet between nodes $i$, $j$, and $k$ is closed, then all three of the adjacenies $a_{ij}$, $a_{jk}$, and $a_{ki}$ have a value of $1$. Therefore, if we could the number of times that $a_{ij}a_{jk}a_{ki} = 1$, we also count the number of closed triplets! This means that the number of closed triplets can be expressed as $\\sum_{i,j,k}a_{ij}a_{jk}a_{ki}$. \n",

    "Further, note that for a given node $i$, that we can find an arbitrary triplet (either open or closed) by selecting first one of the neighbors of node $i$, for which there are $d_i$ total, where $d_i = degree(v_i)$. Next, we can select a *different* neighbor of node $i$, for which there are $d_i - 1$ total. This gives us a triplet consisting of node $i$, one of $d_i$ possible nodes, and one of $d_i - 1$ possible nodes, since there will exist at least two edges between them (one edge from node $i$ to one of its $d_i$ neighbors, and the other edge from node $i$ to one of its other $d_i - 1$ neighbors). Therefore, the number of open and closed triplets is the quantity $\\sum_i d_i (d_i - 1)$.  Then we could express the clustering coefficient in terms of the adjacency matrix as:\n",
