    "## Hypothesis Testing with coin flips\n",
    "\n",
    "To describe how hypothesis testing works from an implementation perspective, we'll naturally return to coin flips. A gambler has a coin, and asks us to gamble one dollar. If the coin lands on heads, we obtain our dollar back, and an additional dollar. If the coin lands on tails, we lose our dollar. We get to observe $10$ random coin flips, and determine whether we want to play the game. \n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out, if this coin has a probability of landing on heads greater than $0.5$, we will, over time, *make* money if we continue to play the game. If the coin has a probablity of landing on heads less than $0.5$, we will, over time, *lose* money if we continue to play the game. So, if we are going to play the game in a principled way, we want to be really sure that we are going to gain money by playing. How can we use hypothesis testing to use a little bit of math to determine whether we should play or not?\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we need to delineate our hypotheses. Here, our question of interest is, should we play the game? Therefore, the alternative hypothesis is the one where we *should* play the game, or the coin has a probability greater than $0.5$. The null hypothesis is that we should *not* play the game, or the coin has a probability that is not greaterr than $0.5$. If we use $p$ to denote the probability that the gambler's coin lands on heads, we write this as $H_A: p > 0.5$, against the null hypothesis that $H_0: p \\leq 0.5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that we observe $10$ coin flips, and we see that the coin lands on heads $6$ times. If we were to estimate the coin's probability of landing on heads, like we did in the [Preface of the Section on MLE](ch6:mle), we would get that $\\hat p = \\frac{6}{10}$, or that our estimate $\\hat p = 0.6$. It's pretty obvious that $\\hat p$ is greater than $0.5$, so we should play the game, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is a little more complicated than that. If you take a fair coin (one that is roughly equally likely to land on heads and tails) and flip it enough times, you will probably find a sequence of ten flips with six heads. We are scientists, after all, so we want to be *really* sure that if we play we are going to make money. In statistical speak, we want to be sure that if we play the game, there is a low chance that we are actually wrong. We want to know exactly what the chances are that, if we were *wrong*, we could still have seen the estimate $\\hat p$ that we calculated. This is where a concept called a *p-value* comes into play. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### $p$-values tell us the chances of observing an outcome if the null hypothesis is true\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the $p$-value, we must first introduce a concept called a *test statistic*. A **test-statistic** is a fancy word for a data-derived quantity that summarizes our data (which is the definition of a *statistic*) with a single number which will be used for hypothesis testing (and hence, it is a *test statistic*). The test statistic should capture a property of the data that is relevant to our question of interest (here, the probability that the coin lands on heads), so it makes sense in our example to just use the estimate of the probability that the coin lands on heads as our test statistic. In general, the **$p$-value** is the probability that we would incorrectly reject the null hypothesis (that is, that the coin is fair) in favor of the alternative hypothesis (that is, that the coin is not fair) if the null hypothesis were really true. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to think about what types of values we would see from the test statistic if the null hypothesis were true. If the coin really had a probability of $0.5$ of landing on heads and we flipped it $10$ times, there is a non-zero probabaility that we would see all heads and our estimate would have been $1.0$, that we would see $9$ heads and $1$ tails and our estimate would have been $0.9$, so on and so-forth all the way to the outcome where we see only tails and our estimate would have been $0.0$. Which one we observed when watching the gambler flip the coin would come down to *random chance*, so we will use the random variable $\\mathbf{\\hat p}_0$ to describe this quantity. Specifically, $\\mathbf{\\hat p}_0$ is a random variable which takes values between $0$ and $1$ in $0.1$ probability increments. $\\mathbf{\\hat p}_0$'s probability of taking a given increment $k$ is equal to the probability that we would have estimated the probability to be $k$ if the null hypothesis (the coin is fair and lands on heads with probability $0.5$) were true. $\\mathbf{\\hat p}_0$ takes each increment with the following probabilities:"

    "So, this is a little surprising! Even if the null hypothesis were true and the coin really landed on heads with a probability of $0.5$, there is still a pretty good chance we would observe a probability of at least $0.6$ if we were to flip a fair coin $10$ times. We describe this quantity using a $p$-value, which is the probability of seeing a test statistic at least as extreme as the one we calculated from our data if the null hypothesis were true. Here, the $p$-value is the probability that, if the coin were fair, we would produce an estimate of $0.6$, $0.7$, $0.8$, $0.9$, or $1.0$. This is the sum of all of the heights of the corresponding bars in the above plot, which turns out to be $0.377$.

    "This might be enough for you to play the game, but as scientists we usually like to be a little more confident than this when we report something.

In this case, we only have a single sample, which are the outcomes from each of the coin flips.

    "When the networks were unweighted, everything made complete sense in the context of our coin flip regime. For weighted networks, on the other hand, things can go a *little* bit differently. To understand this question in the context of weighted networks, we'll return to our discussion on the SIEM, and reformulate it a little bit for the case where the adjacency matrix's entries take non-binary values (they aren't just zeros and ones).\n",

    "\n",
    "The second parameter is a little different. Remember for the unweighted case, we had a probability vector, $\\vec p$, whose entries $p_k$ indicated the probability of an edge in the $k^{th}$ edge cluster.

As it turns out, what this says at a deeper level is that $\\mathbf a_{ij}$ has a *distribution* whose parameter is just a probability $p_{z_{ij}}$. The distribution, in this case, is the *Bernoulli* distribution with probabilty $p_{z_{ij}}$, which we learned about in [the preface for chapter 5](#link?). However, there are other distributions we could use as well for $\\mathbf a_{ij}$. \n",

These bars would be centered roughly around the mean value $\\mu$, the bars would be roughly symmetric (the heights on either side of the mean would be about equal), and that about $68\\%$ of the data would be between $\\mu - \\sigma$ and $\\mu + \\sigma$ (within one standard deviation). In the below plot, we will simulate $10,000$ samples $x_i$ of random variables $\\mathbf x_i$, which are Normally distributed with a mean of $0$ and a standard deviation of $5$, $10,000$ samples $y_i$ of random variables $\\mathbf y_i$ with are Normally disributed with a mean of $5$ and a standard deviation of $5$, and $10,000$ samples $z_i$ of random variables $\\mathbf z_i$ which are Normally distributed with a mean of $0$ and a standard deviation of $15$.

    "Next, let's come up with a working example for the weighted SIEM network. Let's imagine that we have the brain of an individual. The $n=100$ nodes are areas of the brain. For instance, there is a node of the brain responsible for movement, an area of the brain which is responsible for sight, so on and so forth. As you may be aware, the brain is split into two hemispheres, the left and right hemispheres. In many cases, these areas of the brain have a *bilateral analogue*, which means that the same area of the brain appears in the left and right hemispheres. While the region of the brain may have a slightly different function in each of the two hemispheres, they tend to work together to perform functions for the individual. For instance, if the left motor area is active when someone is walking, the right motor area will tend to be active too. In this case, our edge weights are how strongly two regions of the brain tend to *correlate* with one another over the course of the day. \n",

If we organize the nodes first by hemisphere (left, then right) and second by the region of the brain, what we would anticipate is that the bilateral areas would tend to be higher correlated than non-bilateral areas. This would be reflected as an \"off-diagonal\" band (the *bilateral band*, cluster 2) that tends to have higher values than the other entries of the adjacency matrix (*non-bilateral edges*, cluster 1). The way we will simulate this is as follows. The non-bilateral edges will have a distribution that is between $-0.5$ and $0.5$, with no particular values being more or less likely.

    "Now that we are in a statistical testing mindset, a question you might have is that the correlations for cluster two tend to look much larger than the correlations for cluster one. How do we formalize this relationship? We can't use the fisher's exact test, since the fisher's exact test only worked for the case where our network was unweighted and the adjacency matrix took only binary values ($0$ or $1$). What can we do for a weighted network, when the adjacency matrix is not resticted to binary values? To formalize our situation a bit more, let's return to making some hypotheses about the data. We want to test whether the correlations in the second cluster exceed the correlations in the first cluster. This means that we have an alternative hypothesis $H_A:$ correrlations in cluster two $>$ correlations in cluster one. Remember that for two sample testing, the null hypothesis is going to be the opposite, so $H_0:$ correlations in cluster two $\\leq $ correlations in cluster one. This is the weighted two-sample hypothesis testing problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon $U$ Test\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a variety of approaches to overcoming the weighted two-sample hypothesis testing problem. A popular approach is known as the two-sample $t$-test, which basically means that we assume that the samples are really just normally distributed, with some mean and variance, and then we forget about the actual data after we estimate these means and variances. In so doing, we construct a test statistic by using properties about the normal distribution (e.g., that the mean and the variance are the *only* useful pieces of information in the data), not the actual data itself. To read more about the two-sample $t$-test, we would recommend you check out the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test). Unfortunately, if the data is not well-summarized by a normal distribution, the $t$-test tends to be a fairly poor choice for hypothesis testing. Instead, what we tend to use for the weighted two-sample hypothesis testing problem is we turn to what is known as the $U$-test. Instead of relying on assumptions that the data is normally distributed, the $U$-test does not assume anything about the nature of the distribution itself. The only assumptions that it makes are that the data (in this case, the edges for each cluster) is independent, which falls right in line with the generative description we gave for the SIEM. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of this, intuitively, as the $t$-test assuming the data distribution following the \"bell shape\" of the normal distribution (and therefore, tries to compare two \"bell shaped\" curves), whereas the $U$-test does not make this assumption and instead only uses the data itself. Even when the data is normally distributed, the $U$-test still tends to perform almost as well as the $t$-test. For this reason, we find the $U$-test to be a better procedure than other forms of testing that make heavy assumptions about the distributions of edge weights.\n",
