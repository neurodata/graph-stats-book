In the simplest case, we will assume that $F$ is a distribution on a subset of the possible real vectors that have $d$-dimensions with an important caveat: for any two vectors within this subset, their inner product *must* be a probability. We will refer to the subset of the possible real vectors as $\\mathcal X_K$, which we learned about above. This means that for any $\\vec x_i, \\vec x_j$ that are in $\\mathcal X_K$, it is always the case that $\\vec x_i^\\top \\vec x_j$ is between $0$ and $1$. This is essential because like previously, we will describe the distribution of each edge in the adjacency matrix using $\\vec x_i^\\top \\vec x_j$ to represent a probability. Next, we will treat the latent position matrix as a matrix-valued random variable which is *latent* (remember, *latent* means that we don't get to see it in our real data). Like before, we will call $\\vec{\\mathbf x}_i$ the random latent positions for the nodes of our network. In this case, each $\\vec {\\mathbf x}_i$ is sampled independently and identically from the inner-product distribution $F$ described above.

Remember that $\\mathbf X$ is just a matrix whose rows are $\\vec {\\mathbf x}_i$, each of which individually have have the distribution $F$; e.g., $\\vec{\\mathbf x}_i \\sim F$ independently. For simplicity, we will assume that $F$ is a disrete distribution on $\\mathcal X_K$. This makes the logic of what is going on below much simpler since the notation gets less complicated, but does not detract from the generalizability of the result (the only difference is that sums would be replaced by multivariate integrals, and probability mass functions replaced by probability density functions). \n",

Well, $p_{ji} = \\vec x_j^\\top \\vec x_i$, which is exactly the same as $p_{ij}$! This means that even if we were to consider a directed RDPG, the probabilities that can be captured are *always* going to be symmetric. The generalized random dot product graph, or GRDPG, relaxes this assumption. This is achieved by using *two* latent positin matrices, $X$ and $Y$, and letting $P = X Y^\\top$. Now, the entries $p_{ij} = \\vec x_i^\\top \\vec y_j$, but $p_{ji} = \\vec x_j^\\top \\vec y_i$, which might be different.\n",

    "In the preceding models, we typically made assumptions about how we could characterize the edge-existence probabilities using fewer than $\\binom n 2$ different probabilities (one for each edge). The reason for this is that in general, $n$ is usually relatively large, so attempting to actually learn $\\binom n 2$ different probabilities is not, in general, going to be very feasible (it is *never* feasible when we have a single network, since a single network only one observation for each independent edge). Further, it is relatively difficult to ask questions for which assuming edges share *nothing* in common (even if they don't share the same probabilities, there may be properties underlying the probabilities, such as the *latent positions* that we saw above with the RDPG, that we might still want to characterize) is actually favorable.\n"

Further, if we restrict ourselves to the case of simple networks like we have done so far, $P$ will also be symmetric ($p_{ij} = p_{ji}$ for all $i$ and $j$). The generative model is similar to the preceding models we have seen: given the $(i, j)$ entry of $P$, denoted $p_{ij}$, the edges $\\mathbf a_{ij}$ are independent $Bern(p_{ij})$, for any $j > i$. Further, $\\mathbf a_{ii} = 0$ for all $i$ (the network is *loopless*), and $\\mathbf a_{ji} = \\mathbf a_{ij}$ (the network is *undirected*).

This means that, for instance, if we were to consider only the probability matrices where all of the entries are the same, we could represent the ER models. Similarly, if we were to only to consider the probability matrices $P$ where $P = XX^\\top$, we could represent any RDPG.\n",

    "The IER Random Network can be thought of as the limit of Stochastic Block Models, as the number of communities equals the number of nodes in the network. Stated another way, an SBM Random Network where each node is in its own community is equivalent to an IER Random Network. Under this formulation, note that the block matarix for such an SBM, $B$, would have $n \\times n$ unique entries. Taking $P$ to be this block matrix shows that the IER is a limiting case of SBMs.\n",
