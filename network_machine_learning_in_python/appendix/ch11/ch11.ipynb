    "In this section, we'll do a much deeper dive into the intricacies of network modelling. It is important to note that the models you'll learn about here may sound a *little* different from the models you saw earlier in the book, but this in intentional: in this section we'll be describing the models using far more statistically precise language. With this added language in hand, which may *appear* cumbersome at first, you can describe a wide variety of variations of the models you learned about previously. You'll be able to more succinctly, and more directly, understand *exactly what* is being modelled, what is being treated as random, and what is being treated as fixed. Many of the strategies that you learned about in previous sections, such as the [latent position graph testing](#todo) and [latent distribution testing](#todo), become a lot more digestable when you understand them as tests which assume slightly different statistical models. Let's get to it. In this section, you'll learn the following aspects:\n",
