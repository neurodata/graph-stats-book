    "# Maximum Likelihood Estimate Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will introduce a fundamental estimation technique, known as maximum likelihood estimation. To understand this section, we think that you should have a decent working knowledge of undergraduate probability and statistics, but we don't think it will be too challenging beyond this. We will cover maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and some basic results about why MLE is a strategy which gives us some desirable estimators we can use to learn about the underlying random networks for our network-valued data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout [Chapter 5](#link?), we spent a lot of attention developing intuition for many of the network models that are essential to understanding random networks. Recall that the notation that we use for a random network (more specifically, a network-valued random variable), $\\mathbf A$, does *not* refer to any network we could ever hope to see (or as we introduced in the previous chapter, *realize*) in the real world. This issue is extremely important in network machine learning, so we will try to drive it home one more time: no matter how much data we collected (unless we could get infinite data, which we *can't*), we can never hope to understand the true distribution of $\\mathbf A$. As network scientists, this leaves us with a bit of a problem: what, then, can we do to make useful claims about $\\mathbf A$, if we can't actually see $\\mathbf A$ nor its distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where statistics, particularly, **estimation**, comes into play. At a very high level, estimation is a procedure to calculate properties about a random variable (or a set of random variables) using *only* the data we are given: finitely many (in network statistics, often just *one*) samples which we assume are *realizations* of the random variable we want to learn about. The properties of the random variable that we seek to learn about are called **estimands**, and  In the case of our network models, in particular, we will attempt to obtain reasonable estimates of the parameters (our *estimands*) associated with random networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most useful property that we will leverage which was developed in Chapter $5$ is the independent-edge assumption. As we discussed, when working with independent-edge random network models, we will assume that edges in our random network are *independent*. This means that the probability of observing a particular realization of a random network is, in fact, the product of the probabilities of observing each edge in the random network. Notationally, what this means is that if $\\mathbf A$ is a random network with $n$ nodes and edges $\\mathbf a_{ij}$, and $A$ is a realization of that random network with edges $a_{ij}$, then:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    Pr_\\theta(\\mathbf A = A) &= Pr(\\mathbf a_{11} = a_{11}, \\mathbf a_{12} = a_{12}, ..., \\mathbf a_{nn} = a_{nn}), \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\prod_{i, j} Pr_\\theta(\\mathbf a_{ij} = a_{ij}).\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "In the special case where our networks are simple (undirected and loopless), this simplifies to:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    Pr_\\theta(\\mathbf A = A) &= \\prod_{i < j} Pr_\\theta(\\mathbf a_{ij} = a_{ij}).\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "for any network realization $A$ which is simple. This is because if $\\mathbf a_{ij} = a$, then we also know that $\\mathbf a_{ji} = a$, and we only need to worry about one of the edges (we chose the edges in the upper right triangle of the adjacency matrix arbitrarily).  Further, since $A$ is also simple, then we know hat $\\mathbf a_{ii} = 0$; that is, no nodes have loops, so we don't need to worry about the case where $i = j$ either.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will set the scene for the later examples using a common example. Let's say we flip a coin $10$ times, and see $6$ heads. What is the probability that the coin lands on heads? Intuitively, the answer is rather simple! It feels like it should just be $\\frac{6}{10}$. And in one particular way, that really is the *best* guess we could make!\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we discuss the nitty-gritty technical details of how we learn about random networks using a particular method known as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Maximum likelihood estimation is why $\\frac{6}{10}$ is a great guess for our coin flip example. Finding MLEs can be pretty difficult, so we leave the details in starred sections. If you aren't familiar with MLE, you can skip these, and still learn how to use the results!\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Method of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about what exactly this means using an example that you are likely familiar with. I have a single coin, and I want to know the probability of the outcome of a roll of that coin being a heads. For sake of argument, we will call this coin *fair*, which means that the true probability it lands on heads (or tails) is $0.5$. In this case, I would call the outcome of the $i^{th}$ coin flip the random variable $\\mathbf x_i$, and it can produce realizations which take one of two possible values: a heads (an outcome of a $1$) or a tails (an outcome of a $0$). We will say that we see $10$ total coin flips. We will number these realizations as $x_i$, where $i$ goes from $1$ to $10$. To recap, the boldfaced $\\mathbf x_i$ denotes the random variable, and the unbolded $x_i$ denotes the realization which we actually see. Our question of interest is: how do we estimate the probability of the coin landing on a heads, if we don't know anything about the true probability value $p$, other than the outcomes of the coin flips we got to observe?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, since $\\mathbf x_i$ takes the value $1$ or $0$ each with probability $0.5$, we would say that $\\mathbf x_i$ is a $Bernoulli(0.5)$ random variable. This means that the random variable $\\mathbf x$ has the Bernoulli distribution, and the probability of a heads, $p$, is $0.5$. All $10$ of our $\\mathbf x_i$ are called *identically distributed*, since they all have the same $Bernoulli(0.5)$ distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also assume that the outcomes of the coin flips are mutually independent, which as we learned previously, just means that the probability of observing all $n$ outcomes simultaneously is the product of observing each outcome individually:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    Pr_\\theta(\\mathbf x_1 = x_1, ..., \\mathbf x_n = x_n) &= \\prod_{i = 1}^nPr_\\theta(\\mathbf x_i = x_i)\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "For any one coin flip, the probability of observing the outcome $i$ is, by definition of the Bernoulli distribution:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    Pr_\\theta(\\mathbf x_i = x_i) = p^{x_i} (1 - p)^{1 - x_i}.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Note that we use the notation $Pr_\\theta$ to indicate that the probability is a function of the parameter set $\\theta$ for the random variable $\\mathbf x_i$. Here, since the only parameter for each $\\mathbf x_i$ is a probability $p$, then $\\theta = p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we saw $n$ total outcomes, the probability is, using the definition of mutual independence:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    Pr_\\theta(\\mathbf x_1 = x_1, ..., \\mathbf x_{n} = x_{n}; p) &= \\prod_{i = 1}^{n}Pr(\\mathbf x_i = x_i), \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\prod_{i = 1}^n p^{x_i}(1 - p)^{1 - x_i}, \\\\\n",
    "    &= p^{\\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i}(1 - p)^{n - \\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i}.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "What if we saw $10$ coin flips, and $6$ were heads? Can we take a \"guess\" at what $p$ might be? Intuitively your first reaction might be to say a good guess of $p$, which we will abbreviate $\\hat p$, would be $0.6$, which is $6$ heads of $10$ outcomes. In many ways, this intuitive guess is spot on. However, in network machine learning, we like to be really specific about why, exactly, this guess makes sense. \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the above equation, one thing we can do is use the technique of **maximum likelihood estimation**. We call the function $Pr(\\mathbf x_1 = x_1, ..., \\mathbf x_n = x_n; p)$ the *likelihood* of our sequence, for a given value of $p$. Note that we have added the term \"$; p$\" to our notation, which is simply to emphasize the dependence of the likelihood on the probability. So, what we *really* want to do is find the value that $p$ could take, which *maximizes* the likelihood. Let's see what the likelihood function looks like as a function of different values of $p$:"

    "### Studying sampling distributions of estimators\n",
    "\n",
    "When discussing how \"good\" estimators do, there are a few nuances to consider. The first is that an estimator can only be studied for its \"effectiveness\" in the context of what it is \"effective\" at studying. Stated another way, an estimator can only be studied in the context of the *assumed statistical model*. \n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that if we want to study the estimator we are interested in, such as the probability estimator we learned above, we have to take a big conceptual leap: we need to assume that the realization we are presented with, $A$, is *truly* a realization of a random network $\\mathbf A$ that we can quantify properties about. It is important to realize that for all the reasons we listed in [the preface to Chapter 5](#link?) (and potentially many reasons we didn't even touch on), that this will almost never be the case. This means that statistical inference tends to proceed as follows:\n",
    "1. Develop a statistical model, which the data can *reasonably* be assumed to follow,\n",
    "2. Produce an estimator of some useful quantity for that statistical model,\n",
    "2. Study the estimator's properties, in the context of the statistical model we assumed the data followed.\n",
    "\n",
    "What other nuances do we need to consider? Well, first of all, our realization $A$ comes down to *random chance*. This is due to the fact that it is a realization of a random variable $\\mathbf A$. When we study properties of our estimator, the estimate we produce also has an element of randomness in the same vein: when $A$ a realization of a random variable $\\mathbf A$, our estimate of a parameter of $\\mathbf A$ is a realization of an underlying random quantity too. If the estimator we are using is $\\hat\\theta_n$ ($\\hat\\theta_n$ is just an arbitrary estimator, such as the probability estimator for an $ER_n(p)$ network, $\\hat p_n$, shown above, where we just added the \"n\" to emphasize that the estimator's effectiveness is a function of the number of nodes in the network).\n",
    "\n",
    "To what extent the estimate would be different is a function of the *sampling distribution* for the estimator. The **sampling distribution** of an estimator $\\hat \\theta_n$  is the probability distribution followed by the underlying random quantity $\\mathbf{\\hat \\theta}_n$ for a particular number of nodes $n$. This can be intuitively reasoned to as follows: if we produce an estimate of a parameter for $\\mathbf A$, maybe if our data was slightly different (but still a realization of $\\mathbf A$, just a different one), we would have obtained a *different* estimate. The extent to which this estimate might differ is a function of the sampling distribution for the estimator, and is the backbone of what we want to study.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unbiasedness of the estimate of the probability parameter for the ER network\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to repeat our experiment again and again, getting a new network each time, it would be great if our estimate of the probability were, on average, the correct value, right? This core idea underlies the concept of the *unbiasedness* of an estimate in statistical theory. An estimator is **unbiased** for an underlying parameter if it can be expected to attain that parameter using *only* the sample data. For this section, we'll change our notation up slightly; we'll use the term $\\hat p_n$ to mean the probability estimate we produce for a realization with $n$ nodes. In this case for the probability parameter, what this means is that $\\mathbb E[\\hat p_n] = p$, or that we would expect our estimate of the probability $\\hat p_n$ to be equal to the true probability $p$. The reason we introduce the subscript $n$ is to emphasize *really* strongly that the expected value is for a *particular* number of nodes which is *totally arbitrary*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started on deciding how to attack this problem, we should first specify what unbiasedness is *not* to give you some more intuition. What unbiasedness does *not* say is that the estimate $\\hat p_n$ itself is equal to the probability $p$. This means we wouldn't expect, in general, for our estimate to be exactly equal to the true parameter we are trying to estimate. All that it says is, if the underlying random network $\\mathbf A$ can be *truly* described by the $ER_n(p)$ random network, and if our realization $A$ is really a realization of $\\mathbf A$, that the estimate we would produce from our data $A$ would be equal to the probability parameter that $\\mathbf A$ has. If an estimator is unbiased, this would mean that if we looked at a bunch of realizations of $\\mathbf A$, that on average, the estimates would equal the true parameter of $A$. Stated another way, if we had infinite realizations of $\\mathbf A$, and then for each of these realizations of $A$ we computed an estimate of the probability $\\hat p$, that the average of *those* estimates would be $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So all of the quantities that are *not* parameters of the underlying statistical model (in this case, the number of nodes and the probability $p$) will be random variables here, since *only* $n$ and $p$ determine the underlying random system we got to realize.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do we get started here? Well, we begin with just writing down what we know so far. The expected value of the estimate of the probability is obviously equal to the expected value of the equation we have above, since the estimate of the probability is equal to this thing:\n",

    "    \\mathbb E[\\mathbf{\\hat p}_n] &= \\mathbb E\\left[\\frac{\\mathbf m}{\\binom n 2}\\right] .\n",

    "    \\mathbb E[\\mathbf{\\hat p}_n] &= \\frac{1}{\\binom n 2}\\mathbb E[\\mathbf m].\n",

    "\n",
    "Next, we use the underlying statistical model that we have. We remember that *every* edge in an ER random network $\\mathbf a_{ij}$ is like a coin flip with a probability of landing on heads of $p$, so there is nothing really unique about any particular edge.

    "    \\mathbb E\\left[\\sum_{i < j}\\mathbf a_{ij}\\right] &= \\binom n 2\\mathbb E[\\mathbf a_{ij}].\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Finally, we'll use a thing called the law of total expectation, which basically says that the expected value of a random variable is the (probability weighted) average of the possible values that random variable could take. This means that since $\\mathbf a_{ij}$ can only take values of $0$s and $1$s, that the expected value is:\n",

    "The use behind a parametric bootstrap is, we have some random quantity which we think follows a particular distribution (e.g., it is a *parametric quantity*, or a random variable with a particular parameter), and we want to see what some *function* of that random variable looks like when we manipulate it in a way which makes the distribution a *lot* harder to work with! For instance, if we had a random variables $\\mathbf x$ and $\\mathbf y$ which followed a normal distribution with mean $0$, variance $1$, and were independent, we might not know off the top of our heads that $\\mathbf x^2 + \\mathbf y^2$ was chi-squared distributed with $2$ degree of freedoms. However, if we did a parametric bootstrap, we could still take a guess at properties about $\\mathbf x^2 + \\mathbf y^2$ just by simulating it. We begin by simulating 1000 realizations of $\\mathbf x$ and $\\mathbf y$, and then looking at how the squares of these realizations behave:"

    "\n",
    "While the unbiasedness property is great for us, it is important to highlight another limitation of unbiasedness: unbiasedness tells us *only* that if we repeated the experimental setup we had again and again, the average of our estimates of the probability would be the true probability. But there's a caveat: we only conduct our experiment once! We need to know that if we conducted our experiment in a reasonable way (collecting as much data as possible) that our estimate $\\hat p$ of the underlying parameter $p$ is reasonable. The property that we care about here is called *asymptotic consistency*, or *consistency* for short. An estimator is **asymptotically consistent** if, as the number of nodes in the network increases, the estimator converges *in probability* to the true underlying parameter. What the heck does this mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a mathematical statement, asymptotic consistency is written that, for any possible choice of $\\epsilon$ which exceeds zero, that $Pr(|\\mathbf{\\hat p}_n - p| > \\epsilon) \\rightarrow 0$, as the number of nodes grows to infinity. In other words, if we were to see a network which was *big enough*, our estimate of the probability of that network would be *really close* to the true probability of the network $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out, this really isn't too difficult for us to prove. To prove this statement, we're going to first need the variance of $\\mathbf{\\hat p}_n$, which we'll see why in a second. Let's get started by plugging in the definition of $\\mathbf {\\hat p}_n$:\n",

In statistics, we don't really worry too much about $\\geq$ and $\\leq$ compared to $>$ and $<$ when a random variable is *continuous* on some interval, so these specifics aren't too important to us here. As we can see, however, this statement looks *really* similar to the one we needed for convergence in probability, and it is, in fact, exactly what we will use to prove convergence in probability. Notice that in this case, $\\sigma$ is just a constant (it is a *parameter* of $\\mathbf {\\hat p}_n$, and parameters are constant), and that this inequality holds true for *any* constant $k > 0$. So what if we pick $k$ to be $\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\sigma}$? Let's find out. Remember that the mean of $\\mathbf {\\hat p}_n$ was just $p$, which we use here:\n",

We have finished off our proof, and we can say that $Pr(|\\mathbf{\\hat p}_n - p| \\geq \\epsilon) \\rightarrow 0$ as $n$ goes to infinity. This is equivalent to what we said previously in the statement for asymptotic consistency, with the exception that we have a $\\geq$ instead of a $>$ sign.

What we want to show is that, as $n$ grows, the amount we are \"off\" by in our computation of $\\hat p_n$ gets arbitrarily small. Basically, the \"interval\" around $\\hat p_n$ for our estimates should be shrinking down to zero as $n$ gets large.

    "\n",
    "By a similar argument to the one we made for the probability parameter $\\hat p$ for an ER network, the estimator of the probability parameter $\\hat b_{l,l'}$ is unbiased and consistent for the probability $b_{l,l'}$ too. However, there's a slight twist: we need our statements to apply to *each community* for the SBM. However, this really isn't much work on top of what we've already done.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unbiasedness result is virtually identical for the *a priori* and *a posteriori* SBMs as it was to the ER random network. The caveat is that none of the communities can have $0$ nodes for the *a posteriori* SBM, and none of the communities can have a probability of $0$ for the *a priori* SBM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The consistency result depends on which model we chose.\n",
    "1. *a posteriori* SBM: Remember that the *a posteriori* SBM fully specifies ahead of time which nodes are in which communities. Instead of having the total number of nodes go to infinity, we simply needs to specify that the estimator is consistent if the number of nodes *in each community* goes to infinity.\n",
    "2. *a priori* SBM: In the *a priori* SBM, we knew that the node assignments took a distribution; here, taking community $k$ with probability $p_k$. In this case, as long as none of the probabilities are identically $0$, the number of nodes in the network going to infinity *implies* that the number of nodes *in each community* goes to infinity, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "## MLEs for other flavors of SBMs\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduced several different variations of the standard SBM, such as the degree-corrected SBM (DCSBM). The approaches we described here work for these types of SBMs, as well, both with the *a priori* and *a posteriori* models. In the interest of keeping the mathematics in this book to a minimum, we won't provide the explicit proofs here, but as an exercise, try and reason to yourself how to obtain reasonable (unbiased and consistent) for the parameters of these models, too! To get you started, the MLE of the degree correction for a node $i$ is just:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\hat \\theta_i &= \\frac{d_i}{m}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "where $d_i$ is the node degree of node $i$, and $m$ is the total number of nodes in the network. You would then \"plug in\" this estimator to the likelihood function for the DCSBM, and then use this to find the maximum likelihood estimate of each block probability, as well."
