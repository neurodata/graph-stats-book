    "# Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we outline some background terminology which will come up repeatedly throughout the book. This section attempts to standardize some background material that most readers should be familiar with going in.\n",

    "## Vectors, Matrices, and Numerical Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this book, we will need some level of familiarity with numerical spaces, and the ways in which we denote them. These will aid greatly in simplifying many of our descriptions that we use throughout the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numerical Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin our discussion with numerical spaces. If you have taken any calculus or algebra course, you are likely familiar with the most basic numerical space, the natural numbers. The natural numbers are denoted by the symbol $\\mathbb N$, which is used to describe the sequence:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\mathbb N &= \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "and continues infinitely. On a similar note, we will frequently resort to short hand to describe subsets of the natural numbers. Let $n$ denote some natural number (for argument's sake, we will suppose that $n$ is $5$). We will use the symbol $\\in$ (read, \"in\") to denote that one quantity is found within a particular set. For instance, in our example, since $5$ is a natural number and $n = 5$, we would say that $n \\in \\mathbb N$, which can be thought of as \"$n$ is in the set of natural numbers\". To describe a subset of the first $n$ natural numbers, we will use the short-hand $[n]$. This short hand could be written out:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    [n] &= \\{1, 2, ..., n\\}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, in our example where $n=5$, we would have:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    [n] &= \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The next most basic numerical space is known as the integers. The set of integers, denoted $\\mathbb Z$, can be described using something called an \"additive inverse of a natural number\", which although it sounds confusing, is really quite simple. For instance, if $n$ is a natural number, then its additive inverse $x$ is just the number where $n + x = 0$. If $n = 5$ from our example above, for instance, $x = -5$. In this case, $-5$ is the additive inverse of $5$. Now, let's describe the integers $\\mathbb Z$. $\\mathbb Z$ can be described using the natural numbers, the additive inverses of all natural numbers, and the number $0$. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\mathbb Z &= \\{..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...\\}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "From $-\\infty$ up to $+\\infty$. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many more numerical spaces, but we will focus on one particular additional numerical space, known as the \"real numbers\". The real numbers, denoted $\\mathbb R$. We won't go into too many details, but the main thing you need to know is that the real numbers include more than enough numbers for our use in this book. Particularly, the real numbers include any natural number, and integer, any decimal, or any irrational number (such as $\\pi$ or $\\sqrt{2}$). The main thing that is interesting about the real numbers is that if we have any two real numbers $x$ and $y$ (remember, this would be written $x, y \\in \\mathbb R$), then the products, ratios, or sums of them are also real numbers:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    x \\cdot y, \\frac{x}{y}, x + y \\in \\mathbb R\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the book, we will build upon some of these numerical spaces and introduce several new ones along the way that are interesing for network machine learning. We will do this by attempting to relate them back to the basic numerical spaces we have introduced here. \n",
    "\n",
    "### One-Dimensional Quantities\n",
    "\n",
    "We will frequently see the term \"dimensional\" come up in this book, and we will attempt to give some insight into what this means here. If we were to say that $x \\in \\mathbb R$, we know from the above description that this means that $x$ is a real-valued number, and is therefore \"in\" the set of real numbers. A one-dimensional quantity is a quantity which is described by a single element from one numerical space. In this instance, $x$ is described by one real number, and is therefore one-dimensional. We will use a lowercase letter (for instance, $x, a, b, \\alpha, \\beta$; the letters may be Roman or Greek) to denote that a quantity is one-dimensional.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Building off the concept of one-dimensional variables, what if we had some variable that instead took two dimensions? For instance, consider the following:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\vec x = \\begin{bmatrix}1.5 \\\\ 2\\end{bmarix}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "As we can see here, $\\vec x$ is now described by two real numbers (namely, $1.5$ and $2$). This means that $\\vec x$ is now a two-dimensional quantity, since we have two separate values needed to describe $\\vec x$. In this case, $\\vec x$ no longer is \"in\" the real numbers, it is instead in the bivariate real vectors, or $\\mathbb R^2$. Here, $\\vec x$ is called a **vector**, and each of its dimensions are defined using the notation $x_1 = 1.5$ and $x_2 = 2$. Here, the notation $x_j$ means the $j^{th}$ dimension of the vector $\\vec x$, where $j$ can be any number from $1$ to the number of dimensions of $\\vec x$. Since $\\vec x$ is two-dimensional, we would say that $j \\in [2]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the general case, for any set $\\mathcal S$, we would say that $\\vec s \\in \\mathcal S^d$ if for any $j \\in [d]$, $s_j \\in \\mathcal S$. For instance, if $\\vec x \\in \\mathbb N^5$, then $x_1$ is a natural number, $x_2$ is a natural number, so on and so forth to $x_5$. \n",
