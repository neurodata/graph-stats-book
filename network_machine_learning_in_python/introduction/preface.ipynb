    "In the early 1990s, a young Computer Science PhD student at Stanford University began thinking about themes for his doctoral thesis, a work which summarizes one's contributions as a PhD student and contextualizes the research output produced during one's tenure. Page had recently become enamored by the internet, and decided to focus on the interconnectedness of the world wide web, which has since become the backbone of the modern internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the assistance of a fellow colleague, Sergey Brin, Page determined that the complicated set of links between documents on the world wide web could best be understood as a large *network*, in which the objects on the world wide web (documents) were interconnected through a series of links. These links were simply computer items which allow one to \"jump\" from one document to the next in a sequential fashion. The number of documents which linked to a reference document, Page and Brin theorized, gave some notion of the \"popularity\", or the *page rank* of the document. Being out-of-the-box thinkers, Page and Brin took this idea and combined it with many other strategies: in particular, they developed a query system which allowed a sentence to be parsed into keywords, and then they developed an indexing system which mapped these keywords to the pages with the highest pagerank. After publishing several papers and getting a number of other computer scientists involved in the project, Page and Brin developed a prototype of the Google search Engine in 1998, and shortly thereafter, founded Google Inc. From there, the rest is history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fast forward over two decades, and networks have become a dominant data structure with which to understand many of the concepts of every day life. Social networks have led to a new rise in the interconnectedness of people, led by massive multi-billion dollar corporations such as Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Instagram, Douyin (TikTok), and WeChat. The economy forms a global interconnected trade network, wherein companies and countries interact with one another for daily commercial benefits. The Earth's food chain forms an ecological network, in which plants and animals fight for survival in an unforgiving world. Neurons of the brain form an interconnected web of axons and synapses, together producing unique aspects about what make you really you. "

    "- Using customers and items as the nodes of a network, purchases as the edges between a customer and an item, and the number of purchases as edge-weights, you can explore the purchasing habits of the most active customers in a purchasing network. \n",

    "- With the nodes as employees, edges as team co-assignment between employees, and node covariates as employee performance, you can isolate groups within your company which are over or underperforming employee expectations.\n",
    "- With the nodes as regions of the brain, the edges as whether two regions of the brain communicate, and network-level covariates as to whether or not each brain represents an individual with a mental health disorder, you can determine subsets of nodes which are most impacted by psychiatric illness.\n",

    "This book is organized into four parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Part I, Foundations, gives you a brief overview of the kinds of things you'll be doing in this book, and shows you how to solve a network machine learning problem from start to finish. It covers the following topics:\n",
    "- What a network is and where you can find networks in the wild\n",
    "- All the reasons why you should care about studying networks\n",
    "- Examples of ways you could apply network machine learning to your own projects\n",
    "- An overview of the types of problems network machine learning is good at dealing with\n",
    "- The main challenges you'd encounter if you explored Network Learning more deeply\n",
    "- Exploring a real network machine learning dataset, to get a broad understanding of what you might be able to learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Part II, Representations, is all about how we can represent networks statistically, and what we can do with those representations. It covers the following topics:\n",
    "- Ways you can represent individual networks\n",
    "- Ways you can represent groups of networks\n",
    "- The various useful properties different types of networks have\n",
    "- Types of network representations and why they're useful\n",
    "- How to represent networks as a bunch of points in space\n",
    "- How to represent multiple networks\n",
    "- How to represent networks when you have extra information about your nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Part III, Applications, is about using the representations from Part II to explore and exploit your networks. It covers the following topics:\n",
    "- Figuring out if communities in your networks are different from each other\n",
    "- Selecting a reasonable model to represent your data\n",
    "- Finding nodes, edges, or communities in your networks that are interesting\n",
    "- Finding time points which are anomalies in a network that is evolving over time\n",
    "- What to do when you have new data after you've already trained a network model\n",
    "- How hypothesis testing works on networks\n",
    "- Figuring out which nodes are the most similar in a pair of networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Part IV, the Appendix, is about providing a more rigorous background in the techniques and approaches described throughout the book. It covers a range of topics found throughout the book, and provides useful academic resources you can explore on your own if you want to delve further into the inner workings of network machine learning."

We would recommend starting with an introduction to machine learning *prior to* focusing on this book, because many of the concepts and ideas of this text will make more sense coming in with a machine learning background, however brief. The core ideas you should remember are the types of machine learning problems, some of the more common algorithms and techniques for machine learning (`K-Means`, testing, and validation each come up a few times), and the basic data structures used for machine learning.\n",

    "+ Ulrik Brandes and Thomas Erlebach's [Network Analysis](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/b106453) (Springer) which focuses on the development of the network data structure and summary statistics for networks.\n",
    "+ Douglas Luke's [A User's Guide to Network Analysis in R](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-23883-8) (Springer) which provides a hands-on introduction to network analytics techniques in the `R` programming language.\n",
    "+ Eric Kolaczyk's [Statistical Analysis of Network Data](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-88146-1) (Springer) which presents some statistical models and methods for network science.\n",

    "If you want to have a good understanding of the appendices, we would recommend that you start with the book [Numerical Linear Algebra](https://www.amazon.com/Numerical-Linear-Algebra-Lloyd-Trefethen/dp/0898713617), by Lloyd Trefethan and David Bau. You will also want to have some exposure to basic statistics and statistical inference; a good introduction is [Statistical Inference](https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Inference-George-Casella/dp/0534243126/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3PTHF60P7B2GN&keywords=statistical+inference&qid=1652449422&s=books&sprefix=statistical+inference%2Cstripbooks%2C64&sr=1-1) by Casella and Berger, and a good refresher is [Mathematical Statistics](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Statistics-Basic-Selected-Topics/dp/0132306379) by Bickel and Doksum. It may also be helpful to be explicitly introduced to statistical learning; our favorite is [Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Statistical-Learning-Applications-Statistics/dp/1461471370), by Gareth Jones, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Rob Tibshirani."
