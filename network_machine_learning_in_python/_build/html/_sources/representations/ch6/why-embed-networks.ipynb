    "Networks by themselves can have interesting properties, but a network is not how we traditionally organize data in machine learning. In almost any ML algorithm - whether you're using a neural network or a decision tree, whether your goal is to classify observations or to predict values using regression - you'll see data organized into a matrix, where the rows represent observations and the columns represent features, or variables. Each observation, or row of the matrix, is traditionally represented as a single point in $d$-dimensional space (if there are $d$ columns in the matrix). If you have two columns, for instance, you could represent data organized in this way on an x/y coordinate plane. The first column would represent the x-axis, and the second column would represent the y-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the data below is organized traditionally. On the left is the data matrix; each observation has its own row, with two features across the columns. The x-column contains the first feature for each observation, and the y-column contains the second feature for each observation. We can see the two clusters of data numerically, through the color mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the right is the same data, but plotted in Euclidean space. Each column of the data matrix gets its own axis in the plot. The x and y axis location of the $i^{th}$ point in the scatterplot is the same as the x and y values of the $i^{th}$ row of the data matrix. We can see the two clusters of data geometrically, through the location of the points."

    "The other problem with network data is its high dimensionality. You could view each element of an adjacency matrix as its own (binary, for unweighted networks) dimension, for instance -- although you could also make the argument that talking about dimensionality doesn't even make *sense* with network data, since it doesn't live in Euclidean space. Regardless, if you were to view the elements of the adjacency matrix as their own dimensions, you can get to a fairly unmanageable number of dimensions fairly quickly. Many dimensions can generally be unmanageable largely because of a machine learning concept called the *curse of dimensionality*, described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} The Curse of Dimensionality\n",
    "Our intuition often fails when observations have a lot of features -- meaning, observations that, when you think of them geometrically, are points in very high-dimensional space. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, pick a point randomly in a 10,000-dimensional unit hypercube (meaning, a $1 \\times 1 \\times \\dots \\times 1$ cube, with ten thousand 1s). You can also just think of this point as a vector with 10,000 elements, each of which has a value between 0 and 1. There's a probability greater than 99.999999% that the point will be located a distance less than .001 from a border of the hypercube. This probability is only 0.4% in a unit square. This actually makes intuitive sense: if you think about measuring a lot of attributes of an object, there's a decent chance it'll be extreme in at least one of those attributes. Take yourself, for example. You're probably normal in a lot of ways, but I'm sure you can think of a part of yourself which is extreme compared to other people.\n",
    "\n",
    "An even bigger shocker: if you pick two random points in a unit square with two dimensions, they'll be on average 0.52 units of distance away from each other. However, if you pick two random points in a unit hypercube with a million dimensions, they'll be around 408 units away from each other. This implies that, on average, any set of points that you generate from some random process when you're in high dimensions will be extremely far away from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this comes down to is that almost every point in ultra-high dimensions is extremely lonely, hugging the edge of the space it lives in, all by itself. These facts mess with many traditional machine learning methods which use relative distances, or averages (very few points in high-dimensional space will actually be anywhere near their average!) {cite:t}`homl`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where network embedding methods come into play. Because networks represented as adjacency matrices are extremely high-dimensional, they run into many of the issues described above. Embedding, much like traditional dimensionality reduction methods in machine learning like Principle Component Analysis (PCA), allows us to move down to a more manageable number of dimensions while still preserving useful information about the network."

The dot product between any two vectors $u_i$ and $u_j$, geometrically, is their lengths multiplied together and then weighted by the cosine of the angle between them.

So, nodes whose latent positions have larger angles between them tend to have lower edge probabilities, and nodes whose latent positions have smaller angles between them tend to have higher edge probabilities.
