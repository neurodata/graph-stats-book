    "In many problems, our network might be more than just the information contained in its adjacency matrix (called its topology, or its collection of nodes and edges). If we were investigating a social network, we might have access to extra information about each person -- their gender, for instance, or their age. If we were investigating a brain network, we might have information about the physical location of neurons, or the volume of a brain region. When we we embed a network, it seems like we should be able to use these extra bits of information - called the \"features\" or \"covariates\" of a network - to somehow improve our analysis. The techniques and tools that we'll explore in this section use both the covariates and the topology of a network to create and learn from new representations of the network. Because they jointly use both the topology of the network and its extra covariate information, these techniques and tools are called joint representation learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary reasons that we might want to explore using node covariates in addition to topological structure. First, they might improve our standard embedding algorithms, like Laplacian and Adjacency Spectral Embedding. For example, if the latent structure of the covariates of a network lines up with the latent structure of its topology, then we might be able to reduce noise when we embed, even if the communities in our network don't overlap perfectly with the communities in our covariates. Second, figuring out what the clusters of an embedding actually mean can sometimes be difficult and covariates create a natural structure in our network that we can explore. Covariate information in brain networks telling us where in the brain each node is, for instance, might let us better understand the types of characteristics that distinguish between different brain regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll explore different ways to learn from our data when we have access to the covariates of a network in addition to its topological structure. We'll explore *Covariate-Assisted Spectral Embedding* (CASE), a variation on Spectral Embedding. In CASE, instead of embedding just the adjacency matrix or its regularized Laplacian, we'll combine the Laplacian and our covariates into a new matrix and embed that."

Using the Stochastic Block Model, we’ll create a simulation using three communities: the first and second community will be indistinguishable in the topological structure of a network, and the second and third community will be indistinguishable in its covariates. By combining the topology and the covariates, we'll get a nice embedding that lets us find three distinct community clusters."

We'd like the third community to be distinct, with only a small probability that nodes in it will connect to nodes in either of the other two communities. \n",

As a result, in our adjacency matrix, we'll see the nodes in communities one and two as a single giant block. On the other hand, nodes in community three only have a 15% chance to connect to nodes in the first community. So, the end result is that we've created a situation where we have three communities that we'd like to separate into distinct clusters, but the topological structure in the adjacency matrix can't separate the three groups by itself."

If your network is *non-assortative* - meaning, the between-block probabilities are greater than the within-block probabilities - it's better to square our Laplacian. This is because the adjacency matrices of non-assortative networks have a lot of negative eigenvalues; squaring the Laplacian gets rid of a lot of annoying negative eigenvalues, and we end up with a better embedding. In the non-assortative case, we end up embedding $LL + aYY^\\top$.
