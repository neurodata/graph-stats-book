    "# Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, many networks we will encounter in network machine learning will *not* be simple networks. As we discussed in the preceding discussion, many of the techniques we discuss will be just fine to use with weighted networks. Unfortunately, real world networks are often extremely noisy, and so the analysis of one real world network might not generalize very well to a similar real world network. For this reason, we turn to *regularization*. **Regularization** is defined as, \"the process of adding information in order to solve an ill-posed problem or to prevent overfitting.\" In network machine learning, what this usually will entail is modifying the network (or networks) themselves to allow better generalization of our statistical inference to new datasets. For each section, we'll pose an example, a simulation, and code for how to implement the desired regularization approach. It is important to realize that you might use several of these techniques simultaneously in practice, or you might have a reason to use these techniques that go outside of our working examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start this section off, we're going to introduce an example that's going to be fundamental in many future sections we see in this book. We have a group of $50$ local students who attend a school in our area. The first $25$ of the students polled are athletes, and thhhe second $25$ of the students polled are in marching band. We want to analyze how good of friends the students are, and to do so, we will use network machine learning. The nodes of the network will be the students. Next, we will describe how the two networks are collected:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Activity/Hobby Network: To collect the first network, we ask each student to select from a list of $50$ school activities and outside hobbies that they enjoy. For a pair of students $i$ and $j$, the weight of their interest alignment will be a score between $0$ and $50$ indicating how many activities or hobbies that they have in common. We will refer to this network as the common interests network. This network is obviously undirected, since if student $i$ shares $x$ activities or hobbies with student $j$, then student $j$ also shares $x$ activities or hobbies with student $i$. This network is weighted, since the score is between $0$ and $50$. Finally, this network is loopless, because it would not make sense to look at the activity/hobby alignment of a student with themself, since this number would be largely uninformative as every student would have perfect alignment of activities and hobbies with him or herself. \n",
    "2. Friendship Network: To collect the second network, we ask each student to rate how good of friends they are with other students, on a scale from $0$ to $1$. A score of $0$ means they are not friends with the student or do not know the student, and a score of $1$ means the student is their best friend. We will refer to this network as the friendship network. This nework is clearly directed, since two students may differ on their understanding of how good of friends they are. This network is weighted, since the score is between $0$ and $1$. Finally, this network is also loopless, because it would not make sense to ask somebody how good of friends they are with themself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our scientific question of interest is how well activities and hobbies align with perceived notions of friendship. We want to use the preceding networks to learn about a hypothetical third network, a network whose nodes are identical to the two networks above, but whose edges are whether the two individuals are friends (or not) on facebook. To answer this question, we have quite the job to do to make our networks better suited to the task! We begin by simulating some example data, shown below as adjacency matrix heatmaps:"

Even though these students are not *totally* disconnected from the rest of the network entirely, and therefore would not be removed by computing the LCC, their presence in our analysis might still lead to stability issues in future network machine learning tasks.

    "### Symmetrizing the network gives us undirectedness\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to learn from the friendship network about whether two people were friends on facebook, a reasonable first place to start might be to *symmetrize* the friendship network. The facebook network is *undirected*, which means that if a student $i$ is friends on facebook with student $j$, then student $j$ is also friends with student $i$. On the other hand, as we learned above, the friendship network was directed. Since our question of interest is about an undirected network but the network we have is directed, it might be useful if we could take the directed friendship network and learn an undirected network from it. This relates directly to the concept of *interpretability*, in that we need to represent our friendship network in a form that will produce an answer or us about our facebook network which we can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason we might seek to symmetrize the friendship network is that we might think that asymmetries that exist in the network are just *noise*. We might assume that the adjacency entries $a_{ij}$ and $a_{ji}$ relate to one another, so together they might be able to produce a single summary number that better summarizes their relationship all together.

To symmetrize the friendship network, what we want is a *new* adjacency value, which we will call $w_{ij}$, which will be a function of $a_{ij}$ and $a_{ji}$. Then, we will construct a new adjacency matrix $A'$, where each entry $a_{ij}'$ *and* $a_{ji}'$ are set equal to $w_{ij}$.  The little apostrophe just signifies that this is a potentially different value than either $a_{ij}$ or $a_{ji}$. Note that by construction, $A'$ is in fact symmetric, because $a_{ij}' = a_{ji}'$ due to how we built $A'$. \n",

    "#### Ignoring a \"triangle\" of the adjacency matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to symmetrize a network $A$ is to just ignore part of it entirely. In the adjacency matrix $A$, you will remember that we have an upper and a lower triangular part of the matrix:\n",

You will notice that for the entries in the upper right triangle of the adjacency matrix, $a_{ij}$ is such that $j$ is *always* greater than $i$. Similarly, the entries which are listed in <font color=\"blue\">blue</font> are called the **lower left triangle of the adjacency matrix below the diagonal**. In the lower left triangle, $i$ is *always* greater than $j$. These are called *triangles* because of the shape they make when you look at them in matrix form: notice, for instance, that in the upper right triangle, we have a triangle with three corners of values: $a_{12}$, $a_{1n}$, and $a_{n-1, n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do we ignore a triangle all-together? Well, it's really quite simple! We will visually show how to ignore the lower left triangle of the adjacency matrix. We start by forming a triangle matrix, $\\Delta$, as follows:\n",

    "    \\end{bmatrix},\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Notice that this matrix *keeps* all of the upper right triangle of the adjacency matrix above the diagonal the same as in the matrix $A$, but replaces the lower left triangle of the adjacency matrix below the diagonal and the diagonal with $0$s. Notice that the transpose of $\\Delta$ is the matrix:\n",

    "    \\end{bmatrix},\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "We're almost there! We just need to add back the diagonal of $A$, which we will do using the matrix $diag(A)$ which has values $diag(A)_{ii} = a_{ii}$, and $diag(A)_{ij} = 0$ for any $i \\neq j$:\n",

This word doesn't mean a whole lot to us for network machine learning, but it has a big implication when we try to use algorithms on many of our networks. Remember that when we have a loopless network, a common practice in network science is to set the diagonal to zero. What this does is it leads to our adjacency matrices being *indefinite* (which means, *not* positive semi-definite).

    "### Lowering edge bias\n",
    "\n",
    "As you are probably aware, in all of machine learning, we are always concerned with the *bias/variance tradeoff*. The [**bias/variance tradeoff**](https://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-to-the-bias-variance-trade-off-in-machine-learning/#:~:text=Bias%20is%20the%20simplifying%20assumptions,change%20given%20different%20training%20data.) is an unfortunate side-effect that concerns how well a learning technique will generalize to new datasets. \n",
    "1. **Bias** is a simplifying assumption of a model that makes the task easier to estimate. For instance, if we have a friendship network, we might make simplifying assumptions, such as an assumption that two athletes frorm different sports have an equally likely chance of being friends with a member of the band. \n",
    "2. On the other hand, the **variance** is the degree to which the an estimate of a task will change when given new data. An assumption that if a player is a football player he has a higher chance of being friends with a band member might make sense given that the band performs at football games. \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"trade-off\" is that these two factors tend to be somewhat at odds, in that raising the bias tends to lower the variance, and vice-versa:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High bias, but low variance**: Whereas a lower variance model might be better suited to the situation when the data we expect to see is noisy, it might not as faithfully represent the underlying dynamics we think the network possesses. A low variance model might ignore that athletes might have a different chance of being friends with a band member based on their sport all together. This means that while we won't get the student relationships *correct*, we might still be able to get a reasonable estimate that we think is not due to overfitting.\n",
    "2. **Low bias, but high variance**: Whereas a low bias model might more faithfully model true relationships in our training data, it might fit our training data a little *too* well. Fitting the training data too well is a problem known as **overfitting**. If we only had three football team members and tried to assume that football players were better friends with band members, we might not be able to well approximate this relationship because of how few individuals we have who reflect this situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we show several strategies to reduce the bias due to edge weight noise in network machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Thresholding converts weighted networks to binary networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to reduce edge bias is the process of *thresholding*. Through thresholding, we choose a threshold value, $t$. Next, we simply set all of the entries of the adjacency matrix less than or equal to $t$ to zero, and the entries of the adjacency matrix above $t$ to one."

    "Some of the most common approaches to choosing this threshold are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set the threshhold to zero: set all non-zero weighted entries to one, and all zero-weight entries to zero. This is most commonly used when we see zero-inflated networks, or networks where the adjacency matrix takes values that are either zero or some quantity different from one, \n",
    "2. Set te threshold to be the mean: set all values below the mean edge-weight to zero, and all values above the mean edge-weight to one,\n",
    "3. Use a quantile: A quantile is a percentile divided by $100$. In this strategy, we identify a target quantile of the edge-weight distribution. What this means is that we are selecting the lowest *fraction* of the edge-weights (where that fraction is the quantile that we choose) and setting these edges to $0$, and selecting the remaining edges to $1$. If we select a quantile of $0.5$, this means that we take the smallest $50\\%$ of edges and set them to zero, and the largest $50\\%$ of edges and set them to $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will show how to use the percentile approach to binarization, with both our activity/hobby and friendship networks. We will threshold using the edge-weight in the $50^{th}$ percentile. Our example networks of activity/hobby and friendship were loopless, as you could see above. Remember as we learned in the preceding section, that if the network itself is loopless, the diagonal entries simply *do not exist*; $0$ is simply a commonly used placeholder. For this reason, when we compute percentiles of edge-weights, we need to *exclude the diagonal*. Further, since this network is undirected, we also need to restrict our attention to one triangle of the corresponding adjacency matrix. We choose the upper-right triangle arbitrarily, as the adjacency matrix's symmetry means the upper-right triangle and lower-right triangle have identical edge-weight distributions. We begin by using this procedure on the friendship network. To complete this processs, we first look at the edge-weight distribution for the friendship network, which is shown below, and identified the edge-weight at the $0.5$ quartile:"

Great job.

Remembering that the number of possible edges was $\\frac{1}{2}n(n - 1)$ for an undirected network, this means that $\\sum_{j > i}a_{ij}$ must be half of $\\frac{1}{2}n(n - 1)$, or $\\frac{1}{4}n(n - 1)$.

With a $z$-score, we will rescale the weights of the adjacency matrix, such that the new edge-weights (called $z$-scores) are approximately normally distributed. The reason this can be useful is that the normal distribution is pretty ubiquitous across many branches of science, and therefore, a $z$-score is relatively easy to communicate with other scientists. Further, many things that exist in nature can be well-approximated by a normal distribution, so it seems like a reasonable place to start to use a $z$-score for edge-weights, too! The $z$-score is defined as follows. We will construct the $z$-scored adjacency matrix $Z$, whose entries $z_{ij}$ are the corresponding $z$-scores of the adjacency matrix's entries $a_{ij}$. For a weighted, loopless network, we use an estimate of the *mean*, $\\hat \\mu$, and the *unbiased* estimate of the *variance*, $\\hat \\sigma^2$), which can be computed as follows:\n",

Unfortunately, we find this often to *not* be the case. In fact, we often find that the specific distribution of edge weights itself often might be lamost infeasible to identify in a population of networks, and therefore *almost* irrelevant all-together. To this end, we turn to instead *ranking* the edges.\n",

    "##### Ranking edges preserves ordinal relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind ranking is as follows. We don't really know much useful information as to how the distribution of edge weights varies between a given pair of networks. For this reason, we want to virtually eliminate the impact of that distribution *almost* entirely. However, we know that if one edge-weight is larger than another edge-weight, that we do in fact trust that relationship. What this means is that we want something which preserves *ordinal* relationships in our edge-weights, but ignores other properties of the edge-weights. An ordinal relationship just means that we have a natural ordering to the edge-weights. This means that we can identify a largest edge-weight, a smallest edge-weight, and every position in between. When we want to preserve ordinal relationships in our network, we do something called *passing the non-zero edge-weights to ranks*. We will often use the abbreviation `ptr` to define this function because it is so useful for weighted networks. We pass non-zero edge-weights to ranks as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify all of the non-zero entries of the adjacency matrix $A$.\n",
    "2. Count the number of non-zero entries of the adjacency matrix $A$, $n_{nz}$.\n",
    "3. Rank all of the non-zero edges in the adjacency matrix $A$, where for a non-zero entry $a_{ij}$, $rank(a_{ij}) = 1$ if $a_{ij}$ is the smallest non-zero edge-weight, and $rank(a_{ij}) = n_{nz}$ if $a_{ij}$ is the largest edge-weight. Ties are settled by using the average rank of the two entries.\n",
    "3. Report the weight of each non-zero entry $(i,j)$ as $r_{ij} = \\frac{rank(a_{ij})}{n_{nz} + 1}$, and for eachh zero entry as $r_{ij} = 0$.\n",

A calculator will give you that $log_{10}(x) = -3, log_{10}(y) = -1$, and $log_{10}(z) = 1$. Even though $y$ is only $.099$ units bigger than $x$, its logarithm $log_{10}(y)$ exceeds $log_{10}(x)$ by two units. on the other hand, $z$ is $9.9$ units bigger than $y$, but yet its logarithm $log_{10}(z)$ is still the same two units bigger than $log_{10}(y)$. This is because thhe logarithm is instead looking at the fact that $z$ is *one* power of ten, $y$ is $-1$ powers of ten, and $z$ is $-3$ powers of ten. The logarithm has *collapsed* the huge size difference between $z$ and the other two values $x$ and $y$ by using exponentiation with *base* ten. \n",
