# Matrix Representations Of Networks

When we work with networks, we need some way of representing the network mathematically and in our code. 

## The Adjacency Matrix

\\ read the part of homl that goes through notation

Although we've been using adjacency matrices for awhile now, we haven't dug too deep into them...

*simplest case (undirected/unweighted)*
The rows of an adjacency matrix represent all of the edges for a particular node. The first row, for instance, represents all of the connections that the first node has with other nodes. 

- nice linear algebraic properties of symmetric matrices?
- 
*directed*

*weighted*
